  abstract = {In this paper, I selectively review recent literature on illegal migration from Mexico to the United States. I begin by discussing methods for estimating stocks and flows of illegal migrants. While there is uncertainty about the size of the unauthorized population, new data sources make it possible to examine the composition of legal and illegal populations and the time-series covariates of illegal labor flows. I then consider the supply of and demand for illegal migrants. Wage differentials between the United States and Mexico are hardly a new phenomenon, yet illegal migration from Mexico did not reach high levels until recently. An increase in the relative size of Mexico's working-age population, greater volatility in U.S.-Mexico relative wages, and changes in U.S. immigration policies are all candidate explanations for increasing labor flows from Mexico. Finally, I consider policies that regulate the cross-border flow of illegal migrants. While U.S. laws mandate that authorities prevent illegal entry and punish firms that hire unauthorized immigrants, these laws are imperfectly enforced. Lax enforcement may reflect political pressure by employers and other interests that favor open borders.}

  abstract = {Objective: To analyze type II diabetes mortality rates geographic distribution and evolution in time across both Mexican border regions during the period 1998-2013. Methods: The work is based on exploratory and inferential data analysis conducted using death reports from the national health information system. The analysis considers social determinants of health as a theoretical paradigm and includes microdata on consumption patterns at household level for the US-Mexico and Mexico- Guatemala border states. Results: A convergence path for type II diabetes mortality rates is found during the last 15 years between the studied border regions. Conclusions: The evidence presented indicates that the southern border states had been experiencing an epidemiologic transition towards mortality causes such as type II diabetes in the last decade. A trajectory that reflects a convergence pattern towards mortality rates found in the northern border states. Objetivo: Analizar la distribución geográfica y evolución temporal de las tasas de mortalidad por diabetes tipo II en el periodo 1998-2013 para las regiones frontera sur y norte de México. Métodos: el trabajo se basa en el análisis exploratorio e inferencial de datos a partir de los registros de mortalidad reportados por el sistema nacional de información en salud SINAIS. El análisis retoma el paradigma teórico sobre determinantes sociales de salud por lo que se consideran microdatos sobre los patrones de consumo a nivel hogar en el contexto de la frontera México-Estados Unidos y México-Guatemala. Resultados: Se encuentra una trayectoria de convergencia durante los últimos 15 años en las tasas de mortalidad por diabetes tipo II entre las dos regiones fronterizas estudiadas. Conclusiones: La evidencia presentada indica que los estados de la frontera sur han experimentado en la última década una transición epidemiológica hacia causas de mortalidad como la diabetes tipo II, una trayectoria que muestra un patrón de convergencia con la población en la frontera norte.},

OBJECTIVE This research assessed an inclusive approach of supplementing official migration statistics, typically reported with a delay, with the so-called big data from Google searches to produce short-term forecasts (“now-casts”) of immigration flows from Romania to the United Kingdom. METHODS Google Trends data were used to create composite variables depicting the general interest of Romanians in migrating into the United Kingdom. These variables were then assessed as predictors and compared with benchmark results by using univariate time series models. RESULTS The proposed Google Trends indices related to employment and education, which exhaust all possible keywords and eliminate language bias, match trends observed in the migration statistics. They are also capable of moderate reductions in prediction errors. CONCLUSIONS Google Trends data have some potential to indicate up-to-date current trends of interest in mobility, which may serve as useful predictors of sudden changes in migration. However, these data do not always improve the accuracy of forecasts. The usability of Google Trends is also limited to short-term migration forecasting and requires understanding of contexts surrounding origin and destination countries.

In spite of its water scarcity, the state of Arizona permits as much as 73\% of its water to be consumed by a single sector, crop production.

  abstract = {The world’s largest deposits of lithium lie in brines found underneath salt flats in the desert between Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Globally, lithium may reduce fossil fuel use by making batteries for cars and renewable energy storage more affordable. This article analyzes ongoing debates about lithium in these three countries to identify what hopes, fears and expectations different stakeholders are bringing to debates about lithium. My approach builds on the idea of resource imaginaries, particularly the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries that highlights the importance of science and technology to projections of desirable futures. I analyze the tensions, visions and metaphors used by different stakeholders, including activists, the media, and state and industry officials, to imagine and thus legitimate lithium extraction. This study finds three co-existing positions in these debates: lithium as a commodity, as a strategic resource or as the subject of a sociotechnical imaginary. Chile, Argentina and Bolivia are converging on the last of these, best described as a reimagining of the relationship between mining and development in which lithium, through innovation and industry, will redefine the relationship between Latin American economies and global markets. This imaginary projects a binary between raw and industrial materials and deterministically assumes that science and technology will transform the former into the latter. Disagreements and challenges notwithstanding, the article argues that this imaginary is evidence of a crisis of confidence in development that is creating space for a more dynamic debate about the social value of mining and the proper role of the state in development. This convergence will have also implications for how sustainable, equitable and reliable lithium production will be.},

  abstract = {The world’s largest deposits of lithium lie in brines found underneath salt flats in the desert between Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Globally, lithium may reduce fossil fuel use by making batteries for cars and renewable energy storage more affordable. This article analyzes ongoing debates about lithium in these three countries to identify what hopes, fears and expectations different stakeholders are bringing to debates about lithium. My approach builds on the idea of resource imaginaries, particularly the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries that highlights the importance of science and technology to projections of desirable futures. I analyze the tensions, visions and metaphors used by different stakeholders, including activists, the media, and state and industry officials, to imagine and thus legitimate lithium extraction. This study finds three co-existing positions in these debates: lithium as a commodity, as a strategic resource or as the subject of a sociotechnical imaginary. Chile, Argentina and Bolivia are converging on the last of these, best described as a reimagining of the relationship between mining and development in which lithium, through innovation and industry, will redefine the relationship between Latin American economies and global markets. This imaginary projects a binary between raw and industrial materials and deterministically assumes that science and technology will transform the former into the latter. Disagreements and challenges notwithstanding, the article argues that this imaginary is evidence of a crisis of confidence in development that is creating space for a more dynamic debate about the social value of mining and the proper role of the state in development. This convergence will have also implications for how sustainable, equitable and reliable lithium production will be.},

Many studies have searched for a direct causal relationship between economic hardship and suicide, however, findings have been varied.Method. Suicide data was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the period between January 1968 and August 2002. These were correlated with a suite of macroeconomic data including housing loan interest rates, unemployment rates, days lost to industrial disputes, Consumer Price Index, gross domestic product, and the Consumer Sentiment Index.Results. A total of 51845 males and 16327 females committed suicide between these dates. There were significant associations between suicide rates and eleven macroeconomic indicators for both genders in at least one age range. Data was divided into male and female and five age ranges and pooled ages. Analyses were conducted on these 132 datasets resulting in 80 significant findings. The data was generally stronger for indices measuring economic performance than indices measuring consumers' perceptions of the state of the economy. A striking difference between male and female trends was seen. Generally, male suicide rates increased with markers of economic adversity, while the opposite pattern was seen in females. There were significantly different patterns in age-stratified data, with for example higher housing loan interest rates having a positive association with suicide in younger people and a negative association in older age groups.Conclusion. Macroeconomic trends are significantly associated with suicide. The patterns in males and females are very different, and there are further substantial age-related differences.}

  abstract = {In Phase III of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) time trends in the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were analysed. Cross-sectional questionnaire surveys with identical protocols and questionnaires were completed a mean of 7 yr apart in two age groups comprising 498,083 children. In the 13- to 14-yr age group 106 centres in 56 countries participated, and in the 6- to 7-yr age group 66 centres in 37 countries participated. A slight worldwide increase in rhinoconjunctivitis prevalence was observed, but the variations were large among the centres and there was no consistent regional pattern. Prevalence increases in the older children exceeding 1\% per year were recorded in 13 centres, including 3 of 9 centres in Africa, 2 of 15 in Asia-Pacific, 1 of 8 in India, 3 of 15 in Latin America, 3 of 9 in Eastern  Europe and 1 of 34 in Western and Northern Europe. Decreasing rhinoconjunctivititis prevalence of similar magnitude was only seen in four centres. The changes were less pronounced in the 6- to 7-yr-old children and only in one centre did any change exceed 1\% per year. The decrease in highest prevalence rates in ISAAC Phase I suggests that the prevalence has peaked in those regions. An increase was recorded in several centres, mostly in low and mid-income countries. The increases were more pronounced in the older age group,  suggesting that environmental influences on the development of allergy may not be limited to early childhood.},

  abstract = {In Phase III of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) time trends in the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were analysed. Cross-sectional questionnaire surveys with identical protocols and questionnaires were completed a mean of 7 yr apart in two age groups comprising 498,083 children. In the 13- to 14-yr age group 106 centres in 56 countries participated, and in the 6- to 7-yr age group 66 centres in 37 countries participated. A slight worldwide increase in rhinoconjunctivitis prevalence was observed, but the variations were large among the centres and there was no consistent regional pattern. Prevalence increases in the older children exceeding 1\% per year were recorded in 13 centres, including 3 of 9 centres in Africa, 2 of 15 in Asia-Pacific, 1 of 8 in India, 3 of 15 in Latin America, 3 of 9 in Eastern  Europe and 1 of 34 in Western and Northern Europe. Decreasing rhinoconjunctivititis prevalence of similar magnitude was only seen in four centres. The changes were less pronounced in the 6- to 7-yr-old children and only in one centre did any change exceed 1\% per year. The decrease in highest prevalence rates in ISAAC Phase I suggests that the prevalence has peaked in those regions. An increase was recorded in several centres, mostly in low and mid-income countries. The increases were more pronounced in the older age group,  suggesting that environmental influences on the development of allergy may not be limited to early childhood.},

  abstract = {Water conflicts are increasingly spilling into the streets in Chile, as communities struggle to make their voices heard in formal decision-making forums. However, these growing social movements are doing much more than just marching. Combining insights from political ecology and legal geography, this article approaches water governance as a complex field of struggle in which social movement resistance plays a crucial role. In the case of the Alto Maipo hydropower conflict in central Chile, social movement actors have taken on a wide range of roles that they feel should correspond to the state: monitoring the hydropower company, documenting citizen concerns, and demanding accountability from government agencies. Attention to the legal dimensions of this struggle reveals how this work of “subsidizing the state” was built into the new institutional order ushered in during the Pinochet dictatorship, and how the capacity of social movement actors to mold this space to their advantage has been restricted by the legal framework for water governance. While there has been considerable attention to the role of resistance from water user associations in reshaping neoliberal water reforms in other parts of Latin America, the Chilean case highlights the need to also consider social movement actors from outside of the conventional water sector who struggle to defend in-stream uses not recognized under the law. Faced with limited legal recourse in the courts and little legitimacy in decision-making forums, Chilean activists have pursued alternative strategies that have expanded the scope of their resistance and built broader political pressure for change.},

However, acute housing need has often struggled to achieve the same level of priority at an international level as the satisfaction of other basic needs, such as for food, water, healthcare and education. In this paper we present a broad-based Global Homelessness Framework as a means of providing a ‘frame of reference’ for cross-national engagement in this field, but recommend that concerted international action focuses on a relatively narrow definition of homelessness encompassing people without any form of accommodation (the ‘unsheltered’ group who are sleeping rough or in places not intended for human habitation) and those living in temporary or crisis accommodation specifically provided for homeless people. We demonstrate that current data is insufficient to generate a comprehensive and defensible worldwide ‘count’ of homeless people, and set out proposals to facilitate moves towards more reliable homelessness estimates at local, national and global levels. At the same time, however, we argue that at least some meaningful trend data is already available for large parts of the Global North, and for some countries and cities in the Global South, so that it would be both feasible and valuable to systematically track these ‘directions of travel’ over time.},

Persons considered chronically homeless by the proposed new definition and, to a  lesser extent, by the two alternative definitions, made heavier use of shelter  compared with persons who met the current definition.

  abstract = {California is home to 12\% of the USA's population, but to 30\% of the nation’s homeless population, some 170,000 people. It is also where half the nation’s unsheltered population live. While homelessness is a major issue for California, there are many conflicting ideas about what to do about it. To design effective programs and policies to address homelessness, we need to understand who is experiencing it, how they became homeless, what their experiences are, and what is preventing them from exiting homelessness. To answer these questions, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative conducted the California Statewide Study of People Experiencing Homelessness (CASPEH), the largest representative study of homelessness since the mid-1990s and the first largescale representative study to use mixed methods (surveys and in-depth interviews). The study was done at the request of California governor Gavin Newsom’s administration, but was not funded by the state. Guided by advisory boards composed of people with lived experience of homelessness and those who work on homelessness programs and policies, we selected eight counties that represent the state’s diversity and recruited a representative sample of adults 18 and older experiencing homelessness throughout California. The investigators conducted the research between October 2021 and November 2022. To augment survey responses, we recruited 365 participants to participate in in-depth interviews. With this context, CASPEH provides evidence to shape programs and policy responses to the homelessness crisis.},

  abstract = {Study Region This study region encompasses the Transboundary San Pedro and Santa Cruz aquifers which are shared between the states of Sonora (Mexico) and Arizona (US). Special regional considerations include a semi-arid climate, basin-fill aquifers with predominantly montane recharge areas, economic drivers in the mining, trade, and military sectors, groundwater-dependent cities with expanding cones of depression, interbasin groundwater transfers, ground- and surface-water contamination, and protected aquatic and riparian habitats that act as significant migration corridors for hundreds of species, including some that are threatened and endangered. Study Focus We focus on lessons learned from the hydrologic assessment of the Transboundary San Pedro and Santa Cruz aquifers. We conducted the work, in two phases: (1) laying the groundwork and (2) implementation. The “laying the groundwork” phase consisted of binational meetings with stakeholders and key actors (agencies and individuals), and the development of an understanding of the physical, institutional, historical, and socio-political context. This led to signing of the binational Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Program (TAAP) agreement in 2009 and detailed the process for cooperation and coordination in the assessment of shared aquifers. The implementation phase began with an agreement to proceed with the study of four “focus” aquifers (Santa Cruz, San Pedro, Mesilla (Conejos-Médanos in Mexico), and Hueco Bolson (Bolsón del Hueco in Mexico)) and development of associated technical teams. Though we do include a brief discussion of the lessons learned from the physical science portion of the study, the results have been described and published elsewhere. The bulk of the paper instead focuses on the findings and lessons learned from the integration of social-science perspectives into a largely physical-science based program, since there is a growing recognition of the need for this type of approach especially in the management and assessment of transboundary aquifers. New Hydrological Insights for the Region The Sonora-Arizona effort succeeded because both countries were adequately represented, and because of flexibility of skills and ability of teams comprising both university and government scientists. Teams included social and earth scientists. Including the social sciences was critical to research design and implementation, and to addressing the cultural, institutional, and socio-political contexts of transboundary aquifer assessment. Significant components of the continuing implementation phase include strategic planning, data compilation and analysis, cross-border integration of datasets, geophysical and geochemical surveys, and internal, peer, and stakeholder engagement.},

Beer drinkers are increasingly seeking new tastes, experiencing different consumption situations and food matching, and demonstrating willingness to pay for superior quality products. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze the recent scientific literature investigating beer demand and beer consumer perceptions and preferences. Using a systematic review, we found 65 journal articles—indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases and published in the period from 2010 to 2019—analyzing beer consumer perceptions and preferences. We observed an increasing interest in recent years among scholars in studying beer consumption from a marketing perspective, especially in the case of craft and premium beer. Studies during the last decade have identified a significant number of determinants characterizing (craft) beer consumption. Sociodemographic characteristics are considered one of the main market segmentation factors, mainly in terms of age, gender, and lifestyle. Among other individual factors, involvement in beer, familiarity with beers and brands, and consumer knowledge of beers and frequency of consumption play a focal role. Moreover, consumption situations and occasions are relevant segmentation variables. Consumer perceptions of new styles of beer and speciality beers (such as sustainable or organic beer) require additional attention from scholars and market analysts. They potentially represent factors generating further differentiation strategies in the beer market for the future. Thus there is a need for further research in this field, along with more cross-country analysis, to better understand beer market particularities and allow beer businesses to meet the multiple expectations of beer consumers.},

Thus there is a need for further research in this field, along with more cross-country analysis, to better understand beer market particularities and allow beer businesses to meet the multiple expectations of beer consumers.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between international trade of avocado and the related virtual water trade over the period 2000–2016. Using a Physical Trade Analysis, we show that commercial and virtual water trade grew rapidly moving almost hand-in-hand in the years taken into account: in parallel with a remarkable increase of international trade of avocado from 0.4 Mt in 2000 to 1.9 Mt in 2016, the global virtual water trade of avocado increased from 408 Mm3 to 2238 Mm3 over the same period. The analysis emphasizes a large disparity between developed and developing countries, with the former being net importer of water and the latter large net exporter. In particular, large avocado-related water flows move from countries already under chronic water stress such as Mexico, Peru and Chile towards more water-rich regions such as US, Japan, Canada and the European Union. As a consequence, the overexploitation of water underlying the avocado trade flows may end up worsening environmental conditions in many relatively poor countries in which the export of avocado is often regarded as an important source of economic growth.},

  abstract = {Background Mexican-born children living in the United States have a lower prevalence of asthma than other US children. Although children of Mexican descent near the Arizona (AZ)-Sonora border are genetically similar, differences in environmental exposures might result in differences in asthma prevalence across this region. Objective The objective of this study was to determine if the prevalence of asthma and wheeze in these children varies across the AZ-Sonora border. Methods The International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Children written and video questionnaires were administered to 1753 adolescents from 5 middle schools: Tucson (school A), Nogales, AZ (schools B, C), and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico (schools D, E). The prevalence of asthma and symptoms was compared, with analyses in the AZ schools limited to self-identified Mexican American students. Results Compared with the Sonoran reference school E, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for asthma was significantly higher in US schools A (OR 4.89, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.72-8.80), B (OR 3.47, 95\% CI 1.88-6.42), and C (OR 4.12, 95\% CI 1.78-9.60). The adjusted OR for wheeze in the past year was significantly higher in schools A (OR 2.19, 95\% CI 1.20-4.01) and B (OR 2.67, 95\% CI 1.42-5.01) on the written questionnaire and significantly higher in A (OR 2.13, 95\% CI 1.22-3.75), B (OR 1.95, 95\% CI 1.07-3.53), and Sonoran school D (OR 2.34, 95\% CI 1.28-4.30) on the video questionnaire compared with school E. Conclusions Asthma and wheeze prevalence differed significantly between schools and was higher in the United States. Environmental factors that may account for these differences could provide insight into mechanisms of protection from asthma.},

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with follow-up from 1976 to 1990. SETTING: 11 U.S. states. PARTICIPANTS: 114,281 female registered nurses aged 30 to 55 years who did not have diagnosed diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer in 1976. OUTCOME MEASURES: Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: 2204 cases of diabetes were diagnosed during 1.49 million person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for age, body mass index was the dominant predictor of risk for diabetes mellitus. Risk increased with greater body mass index, and even women with average weight (body mass index, 24.0 kg/m2) had an elevated risk. Compared  with women with stable weight (those who gained or lost less than 5 kg between age 18 years and 1976) and after adjustment for age and body mass index at age 18 years, the relative risk for diabetes mellitus among women who had a weight gain  of 5.0 to 7.9 kg was 1.9 (95\% CI, 1.5 to 2.3). The corresponding relative risk for women who gained 8.0 to 10.9 kg was 2.7 (CI, 2.1 to 3.3). In contrast, women  who lost more than 5.0 kg reduced their risk for diabetes mellitus by 50\% or more. These results were independent of family history of diabetes. CONCLUSION: The excess risk for diabetes with even modest and typical adult weight gain is substantial. These findings support the importance of maintaining a constant body weight throughout adult life and suggest that the 1990 U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines that allow a substantial weight gain after 35 years of age are misleading.},

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with follow-up from 1976 to 1990. SETTING: 11 U.S. states. PARTICIPANTS: 114,281 female registered nurses aged 30 to 55 years who did not have diagnosed diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer in 1976. OUTCOME MEASURES: Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: 2204 cases of diabetes were diagnosed during 1.49 million person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for age, body mass index was the dominant predictor of risk for diabetes mellitus. Risk increased with greater body mass index, and even women with average weight (body mass index, 24.0 kg/m2) had an elevated risk. Compared with women with stable weight (those who gained or lost less than 5 kg between age 18 years and 1976) and after adjustment for age and body mass index at age 18 years, the relative risk for diabetes mellitus among women who had a weight gain of 5.0 to 7.9 kg was 1.9 (95\% CI, 1.5 to 2.3). The corresponding relative risk for women who gained 8.0 to 10.9 kg was 2.7 (CI, 2.1 to 3.3). In contrast, women who lost more than 5.0 kg reduced their risk for diabetes mellitus by 50\% or more. These results were independent of family history of diabetes. CONCLUSION: The excess risk for diabetes with even modest and typical adult weight gain is substantial. These findings support the importance of maintaining a constant body weight throughout adult life and suggest that the 1990 U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines that allow a substantial weight gain after 35 years of age are misleading.},

Chile's October 2019 popular revolt has again made human rights violations visible in the context of mass mobilizations.

There was excessive use of chemical weapons, and the totality of the chemicals used has not been transparent. The impact on mental health, especially of the population who lived during dictatorship in the 1970s, is uncertain and, health care was overwhelmed in the most vulnerable geographic areas.

It is urgent to establish a timely and transparent system for monitoring such lesions and transparent all chemical compounds in tear-tearing and the composition of kinetic impact projectiles.},

A quantitative analysis of administrative and survey data finds that eviction is commonplace in inner-city black neighborhoods and that women from those neighborhoods are evicted at significantly higher rates than men. A qualitative analysis of ethnographic data based on fieldwork among evicted tenants and their landlords reveals multiple mechanisms propelling this discrepancy. In poor black neighborhoods, eviction is to women what incarceration is to men: a typical but severely consequential occurrence contributing to the reproduction of urban poverty.}

  abstract = {Combining statistical and ethnographic analyses, this article explores the prevalence and ramifications of eviction in the lives of the urban poor. A quantitative analysis of administrative and survey data finds that eviction is commonplace in inner-city black neighborhoods and that women from those neighborhoods are evicted at significantly higher rates than men. A qualitative analysis of ethnographic data based on fieldwork among evicted tenants and their landlords reveals multiple mechanisms propelling this discrepancy. In poor black neighborhoods, eviction is to women what incarceration is to men: a typical but severely consequential occurrence contributing to the reproduction of urban poverty.}

Water plays an important role in the production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become important players in future energy security. The emergent competition for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized in the concept of the “food-energy-water nexus.” The nexus between food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of agriculture and rapid growth in food trade, which results in a massive virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in the food and water security of some regions.

  abstract = {This article is a case study of population growth and composition in the Southern California-Baja California trans-border urban system (TBS). The central question guiding the research is how the combination of geographic proximity and economic integration in two very different regions affects population characteristics in the Southern California-Baja California TBS. We begin by briefly defining trans-border urban systems. We then specify the attributes of the Southern California-Baja California TBS, contrasting them with attributes observed elsewhere in the United States and Mexico. We particularly emphasize the impact of the Mexican-origin population on population growth, composition, age structure and trans-border mobility. We conclude by outlining several national and international policy implications that can be derived from a regional focus on the Southern California-Baja California TBS. The units of analysis are the aggregate TBS and the component counties and municipios. The data are drawn primarily from the U.S. and Mexican censuses. Secondary data from a variety of sources also are discussed.}

Typically, these processes are performed within the framework of competitive intelligence that seeks the collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of information of strategic value on a particular sector, which is transferred to those responsible for making decisions. This article presents the using of market intelligence in the quinoa production chain, mainly finding opportunities in the development of medicinal foods, improving the nutritional properties of consumer products in cereal-based food processing, as well as the trend in the consumption of foods with Protected designation of origin (PDO).},

Many studies have searched for a direct causal relationship between economic hardship and suicide, however, findings have been varied.Method. Suicide data was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the period between January 1968 and August 2002. These were correlated with a suite of macroeconomic data including housing loan interest rates, unemployment rates, days lost to industrial disputes, Consumer Price Index, gross domestic product, and the Consumer Sentiment Index.Results. A total of 51845 males and 16327 females committed suicide between these dates. There were significant associations between suicide rates and eleven macroeconomic indicators for both genders in at least one age range. Data was divided into male and female and five age ranges and pooled ages. Analyses were conducted on these 132 datasets resulting in 80 significant findings. The data was generally stronger for indices measuring economic performance than indices measuring consumers' perceptions of the state of the economy. A striking difference between male and female trends was seen. Generally, male suicide rates increased with markers of economic adversity, while the opposite pattern was seen in females. There were significantly different patterns in age-stratified data, with for example higher housing loan interest rates having a positive association with suicide in younger people and a negative association in older age groups.Conclusion. Macroeconomic trends are significantly associated with suicide. The patterns in males and females are very different, and there are further substantial age-related differences.}

  abstract = {In the European Union, more than 400,000 individuals are homeless on any one night and more than 600,000 are homeless in the USA. The causes of homelessness  are an interaction between individual and structural factors. Individual factors  include poverty, family problems, and mental health and substance misuse  problems. The availability of low-cost housing is thought to be the most  important structural determinant for homelessness. Homeless people have higher  rates of premature mortality than the rest of the population, especially from  suicide and unintentional injuries, and an increased prevalence of a range of  infectious diseases, mental disorders, and substance misuse. High rates of  non-communicable diseases have also been described with evidence of accelerated  ageing. Although engagement with health services and adherence to treatments is  often compromised, homeless people typically attend the emergency department more  often than non-homeless people. We discuss several recommendations to improve the  surveillance of morbidity and mortality in homeless people. Programmes focused on  high-risk groups, such as individuals leaving prisons, psychiatric hospitals, and  the child welfare system, and the introduction of national and state-wide plans  that target homeless people are likely to improve outcomes.},

  abstract = {In the European Union, more than 400,000 individuals are homeless on any one night and more than 600,000 are homeless in the USA. The causes of homelessness are an interaction between individual and structural factors. Individual factors include poverty, family problems, and mental health and substance misuse problems. The availability of low-cost housing is thought to be the most important structural determinant for homelessness. Homeless people have higher rates of premature mortality than the rest of the population, especially from suicide and unintentional injuries, and an increased prevalence of a range of infectious diseases, mental disorders, and substance misuse. High rates of non-communicable diseases have also been described with evidence of accelerated ageing. Although engagement with health services and adherence to treatments is often compromised, homeless people typically attend the emergency department more often than non-homeless people. We discuss several recommendations to improve the surveillance of morbidity and mortality in homeless people. Programmes focused on high-risk groups, such as individuals leaving prisons, psychiatric hospitals, and the child welfare system, and the introduction of national and state-wide plans that target homeless people are likely to improve outcomes.},

We conducted this meta-analysis aiming at providing clear evidence about whether sunlight hours and temperature can affect the risk of suicide. Methods Relevant literature published before 7 Jul 2018 was searched in three electronic database of PubMed, Web of science and Cochrane. Between-study heterogeneity in the effect estimates were examined by study design (i.e., exposure time resolution, temperature measure and suicide classification) and population vulnerability (i.e., sex, national income level, climate zone and study location). Results Regarding temperature-suicide association, we identified 14 studies that provided 23 effect estimates for meta-analysis. Our random-effects model showed that each 1\,°C increase in temperature was significantly associated with a 1\% increase in the incidence of suicide (Incidence Rate Radio (IRR)\,=\,1.01; 95\%CI\,=\,1.00–1.02; p\,{$<$}\,0.05). As for sunlight duration and suicide, 11 effect estimates from 4 studies were pooled using a fixed-effects model. Significant association between sunlight duration (per 1\,h increase) and the risk of suicide was not observed, and the pooled IRR was 1.00 (95\%CI\,=\,0.99–1.01; p\,{$>$}\,0.05).

This study examined the relationship between fidelity to the  Housing First model and residential outcomes among clients of full service  partnerships (FSPs) in California. METHODS: This study had a mixed-methods  design. Quantitative administrative and survey data were used to describe FSP  practices and to examine the association between fidelity to Housing First and  residential outcomes in the year before and after enrollment of 6,584 FSP clients  in 86 programs. Focus groups at 20 FSPs provided qualitative data to enhance the  understanding of these findings with actual accounts of housing-related  experiences in high- and low-fidelity programs. RESULTS: Prior to enrollment, the  mean days of homelessness were greater at high- versus low-fidelity (101 versus  46 days) FSPs. After adjustment for individual characteristics, the analysis  found that days spent homeless after enrollment declined by 87 at high-fidelity  programs and by 34 at low-fidelity programs. After adjustment for days spent  homeless before enrollment, days spent homeless after enrollment declined by 63  at high-fidelity programs and by 53 at low-fidelity programs. After enrollment,  clients at high-fidelity programs spent more than 60 additional days in  apartments than clients at low-facility programs. Differences were found between  high- and low-fidelity FSPs in client choice in housing and how much clients'  goals were considered in housing placement. CONCLUSIONS: Programs with greater  fidelity to the Housing First model enrolled clients with longer histories of  homelessness and placed most of them in apartments.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I selectively review recent literature on illegal migration from Mexico to the United States. I begin by discussing methods for estimating stocks and flows of illegal migrants. While there is uncertainty about the size of the unauthorized population, new data sources make it possible to examine the composition of legal and illegal populations and the time-series covariates of illegal labor flows. I then consider the supply of and demand for illegal migrants. Wage differentials between the United States and Mexico are hardly a new phenomenon, yet illegal migration from Mexico did not reach high levels until recently. An increase in the relative size of Mexico's working-age population, greater volatility in U.S.-Mexico relative wages, and changes in U.S. immigration policies are all candidate explanations for increasing labor flows from Mexico.

  abstract = {In this paper, I selectively review recent literature on illegal migration from Mexico to the United States. I begin by discussing methods for estimating stocks and flows of illegal migrants. While there is uncertainty about the size of the unauthorized population, new data sources make it possible to examine the composition of legal and illegal populations and the time-series covariates of illegal labor flows. I then consider the supply of and demand for illegal migrants. Wage differentials between the United States and Mexico are hardly a new phenomenon, yet illegal migration from Mexico did not reach high levels until recently. An increase in the relative size of Mexico's working-age population, greater volatility in U.S.-Mexico relative wages, and changes in U.S. immigration policies are all candidate explanations for increasing labor flows from Mexico. Finally, I consider policies that regulate the cross-border flow of illegal migrants. While U.S. laws mandate that authorities prevent illegal entry and punish firms that hire unauthorized immigrants, these laws are imperfectly enforced. Lax enforcement may reflect political pressure by employers and other interests that favor open borders.}

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Late preterm births (LPTB, 34 0/7-36 6/7 weeks) account for a growing proportion of prematurity-associated short term morbidities, particularly respiratory, that require specialized care and prolonged neonatal hospital stays. OBJECTIVE: To assess short-term respiratory morbidity in LPTB compared to term births in a contemporary cohort of deliveries in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective collection of electronic data from 12 institutions (19 hospitals) across the United States on 233,844 deliveries between 2002 and 2008. Charts were abstracted for all neonates with respiratory compromise admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and LPTB were compared to term births in regard to resuscitation, respiratory support and respiratory diagnoses. A multivariate logistic regression analysis compared infants at each gestational week controlling for factors that influence respiratory outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), pneumonia, respiratory failure, standard and oscillatory ventilator support. RESULTS: Of 19,334 LPTB, 7,055 were admitted to a NICU and 2,032 had respiratory compromise. Of 165,993 term infants, 11,980 were admitted to a NICU, 1,874 with respiratory morbidity. Respiratory distress syndrome decreased from 10.5\% (390/3700) at 34 weeks to 0.3\% (140/41,764) at 38 weeks. Similarly, TTN decreased from 6.4\% (n=236) to 0.4\% (n=155), pneumonia from 1.5\% (n=55) to 0.1\% (n=62), and respiratory failure from 1.6\% (n=61) to 0.2\% (n=63). Standard and oscillatory ventilator support had similar patterns. Odds of RDS decreased with each advancing week until 38 weeks compared to 39-40 weeks (adjusted OR at 34 weeks 40.1 [95\% CI 32.0-50.3] and at 38 weeks 1.1 [95\% CI, 0.9-1.4]). At 37 weeks odds for RDS were greater than 39-40 weeks (3.1 [95\% CI, 2.5-3.7]), but the odds at 38 weeks did not differ from 39-40 weeks. Similar patterns were noted for TTN (adjusted OR at 34 weeks 14.7 [95\% CI, 11.7-18.4] and at 38 weeks 1.0 [95\% CI 0.8-1.2]); pneumonia (adjusted OR at 34 weeks 7.6 [95\% CI, 5.2-11.2] and at 38 weeks 0.9 [95\% CI, 0.6-1.2]), and respiratory failure (adjusted OR at 34 weeks 10.5 [95\% CI, 6.9-16.1] and at 38 weeks 1.4 [95\% CI, 1.0-1.9]). CONCLUSIONS: In a contemporary cohort, late preterm birth, compared with term delivery, was associated with increased risk for respiratory distress syndrome and other respiratory morbidity.}

We then represent the value of appropriated resources in terms of prevailing market prices. Our results show that in 2015 the North net appropriated from the South 12 billion tons of embodied raw material equivalents, 822 million hectares of embodied land, 21 exajoules of embodied energy, and 188 million person-years of embodied labour, worth \$10.8 trillion in Northern prices – enough to end extreme poverty 70 times over. Over the whole period, drain from the South totalled \$242 trillion (constant 2010 USD). This drain represents a significant windfall for the global North, equivalent to a quarter of Northern GDP. For comparison, we also report drain in global average prices. Using this method, we find that the South’s losses due to unequal exchange outstrip their total aid receipts over the period by a factor of 30. Our analysis confirms that unequal exchange is a significant driver of global inequality, uneven development, and ecological breakdown.},

  abstract = {Groundwater forms the basis for millions of rural and urban livelihoods around the world. Building on insights from the theory of access, in this article we present how groundwater development has brought much well-fare in many parts of the world; and how resulting intensive groundwater use is leading to ill-fare through aquifer overexploitation and processes of water accumulation and dispossession. We show the difficulty of state regulation and the modest achievements of other governance approaches that aim to solve existing groundwater problems. To study these processes we propose a framework of analysis that is based on the study of hydrosocial-networks, the political economy of groundwater and the domains and discourses that define groundwater access. Such analysis highlights the challenges of devising policies and modes of governance that contribute to social and environmental sustainability in intensively used aquifers. These we argue should build on an analysis of equity that scrutinizes the discourses, actors, powers and procedures that define groundwater access. By inciting debates on equity a first and fundamental step can be made toward advancing more inclusive groundwater governance that crucially engages the marginalized and addresses their groundwater problems, concerns and needs.},

  abstract = {Groundwater forms the basis for millions of rural and urban livelihoods around the world. Building on insights from the theory of access, in this article we present how groundwater development has brought much well-fare in many parts of the world; and how resulting intensive groundwater use is leading to ill-fare through aquifer overexploitation and processes of water accumulation and dispossession. We show the difficulty of state regulation and the modest achievements of other governance approaches that aim to solve existing groundwater problems. To study these processes we propose a framework of analysis that is based on the study of hydrosocial-networks, the political economy of groundwater and the domains and discourses that define groundwater access. Such analysis highlights the challenges of devising policies and modes of governance that contribute to social and environmental sustainability in intensively used aquifers. These we argue should build on an analysis of equity that scrutinizes the discourses, actors, powers and procedures that define groundwater access. By inciting debates on equity a first and fundamental step can be made toward advancing more inclusive groundwater governance that crucially engages the marginalized and addresses their groundwater problems, concerns and needs.},

  abstract = {Abstract The emergent crisis of affordable urban housing coupled with a sustained decline in internal migration rates in many Western countries warrants a thorough exploration of the relation between housing costs and internal migration. Although it is well established that housing is an important contextual determinant of migration flows, little attention has thus far been paid to the ways in which rising housing costs shape internal migration. In this paper, we use a time-series of annual intercounty migration in Germany for the period 2004–2017 to examine the association between increasing housing prices and changes in internal migration flows. For this, we apply fixed effects Poisson panel regression models to migration flow tables. Our results show that regions with rising housing costs experience declining inflows. In larger cities, rising housing costs are also associated with increasing outflows. Our study provides new insights into the relationship between house price dynamics and internal migration.},

  abstract = {Abstract People experiencing homelessness usually face social isolation because of relationship breakdown and social stigma. Women represent a minority and experience more psychological distress compared to men. Only a few homelessness services implement group-based interventions that aim at the social re-integration of people experiencing homelessness. The present research aims to provide empirical evidence supporting the use of group-based intervention to promote trust and social connectedness among women experiencing homelessness. The intervention consisted of 10 open-ended group meetings conducted by a female psychologist-facilitator who stimulated the expression and sharing of feelings within the group. A total of 13 women living in a shelter in Italy participated in the intervention. The evaluation procedure consisted of two methodologies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the beginning and the end of the intervention and structured observations were implemented during group meetings. The observation of group dynamics confirmed the benefits of the intervention documenting a transition from isolation and self-reference to trust and social connectedness. The results of the interviews showed that women moved from (T1) loneliness, scepticism and passive desire to (T2) connection with others, care, and confident objective. Implications of the results are discussed in terms of lines of action for services for homeless women.},

  abstract = {Objective: In the United States, loneliness is increasingly becoming a public health crisis. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) report loneliness at rates much higher than the general population. In this secondary data analysis, we examine how subjective and objective social isolation influence perceptions of mental health and well-being. Method: Using a cross-sectional design, we conducted a multivariate hierarchical regression analysis to determine the unique influence both subjective and objective isolation had on perceptions of mental health and well-being in adults with SMI. Results: Rates of reported loneliness in those with SMI was consistent with the literature. Increased perceptions of loneliness were found to be a significant predictor of decreased self-report mental health rating and increased frequency of bothersome symptoms. Increased perceptions of social support were also a significant predictor in increased self-report mental health rating and frequency of bothersome symptoms. Conclusion and Implications for practice: For social workers and providers of services to individuals with SMI, it is important to understand the prevalence of loneliness in the population. It is also critical to provide those with SMI social support and inclusion interventions that aim to increase perceptions of mental well-being. Additionally, the distinction between subjective and objective social isolation provides evaluators of social support interventions a more accurate definition from which to measure.

In this study, drought awareness is defined and operationalized as the relative search interest activities within California, using the search term “drought” from Google Trends. First, the 2011–17 California drought is characterized in the duration–intensity curve with other historical California droughts for comparative purposes, using the 12-month standard precipitation index data (1895–2017). Second, the potential triggers of the peaks of drought awareness during the 2011–17 California drought are investigated through Google Trends and Google Search. The Google Trends data show that the first peak of drought awareness occurred when the drought condition reached its peak and the governor declared the drought emergency (January 2014). The other peaks in August 2014, April 2015, and January 2017 are related to public interest in drought recovery driven by the forecast of the strong El Niño winter of 2014/15, the governor’s issue of water use rules, and California floods in early 2017, respectively. Last, a power-law decay model of drought awareness is fitted to the Google Trends data. According to the fitted power-law model, Californians remained interested in drought after the social trigger–related peaks longer than they did after the natural trigger–related peaks. The findings of this study suggest that it is necessary to develop a more realistic social dynamic modeling for communities that can respond to natural and human triggers and capture interactions with awareness of related disasters.]}

  abstract = {With its hilly terrain and fast-paced growth, Nogales, Sonora, located on the US-Mexico border, is an extremely challenging place for sanitation and potable water provision wherein access to basic services is highly uneven. The labor demands of maquiladoras (typically, foreign-owned assembly plants) draw a steady influx of newcomers to the city, many of whom must turn to land “invasion” to create spaces for affordable housing. With tacit government approval, invasions occur on inexpensive, often topographically precarious land. Officials tend to frame these spaces as “illegal,” and, by extension, those who inhabit them, as existing outside the realm of formal governance. Despite such views, in this paper we understand the distinctions drawn between so-called formal and informal urban governance to unfold along two key axes: regularization of informal land titles and piped water and sanitation. We show how colonia residents feel caught in a state of suspended animation between hope for full urban service provision and trepidation that it will ever reach them. This ambiguity is visible in residents' and government officials' interactions with each other and the public services landscape, and in the unevenness of services provision. We critique the claim that such ambiguousness reflects an instrumental approach within official planning. Instead, we draw from state theory within political geography and political ecology to show how ‘the state’ is an emergent effect of the processes of inclusion and exclusion, an effect constantly destabilized by Nogales's precarious physical geography and uneven urban services grid. Reconceptualizing authority and ambiguity holds quite different implications for the struggle for urban services provision.},

  abstract = {With its hilly terrain and fast-paced growth, Nogales, Sonora, located on the US-Mexico border, is an extremely challenging place for sanitation and potable water provision wherein access to basic services is highly uneven. The labor demands of maquiladoras (typically, foreign-owned assembly plants) draw a steady influx of newcomers to the city, many of whom must turn to land “invasion” to create spaces for affordable housing. With tacit government approval, invasions occur on inexpensive, often topographically precarious land. Officials tend to frame these spaces as “illegal,” and, by extension, those who inhabit them, as existing outside the realm of formal governance. Despite such views, in this paper we understand the distinctions drawn between so-called formal and informal urban governance to unfold along two key axes: regularization of informal land titles and piped water and sanitation. We show how colonia residents feel caught in a state of suspended animation between hope for full urban service provision and trepidation that it will ever reach them.

Data were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register, which includes police and toxicology reports, post-mortem autopsy and Coroner's findings. Poisson and Joinpoint regression were used to study the first aim, and uni-variate and multi-variate logistic regression analyses were applied to investigate the second aim. Suicide method trends showed a significant increase in hanging for both sexes and poisoning with drugs for females, while there was a decline for poisoning by other means for both sexes, and ‘other methods’ decreased for males. Changes in the trends have altered the order of suicide methods, especially in males. Analyses of 8140 suicides were composed by the choice of method, distinguishable profiles by their demographic, clinical and social characteristics, such as having mental or physical illness or different recent life stressors were identified. This suggests that socio-cultural acceptability, and availability are the key drivers in the choice of suicide methods. Continuing increases in hanging is a big challenge in suicide prevention due to its lethality, easy realisation and its increasing acceptability.},

  abstract = {[The effects of the Great Recession on housing equity and homeownership have been well-documented. However, we know little about how rental households fared and the efficacy of housing subsidies in addressing affordability gaps. This paper examines the extent to which rental housing became less affordable for Extremely Low-Income (ELI) households – those earning less than 30\% of the Area Median Income (AMI). I then run regression models to determine the local characteristics most strongly associated with larger affordability gaps, with a focus on whether housing subsidies are effective at combating such gaps. Rental affordability gaps became more pronounced during the Great Recession.

  abstract = {[The effects of the Great Recession on housing equity and homeownership have been well-documented. However, we know little about how rental households fared and the efficacy of housing subsidies in addressing affordability gaps. This paper examines the extent to which rental housing became less affordable for Extremely Low-Income (ELI) households – those earning less than 30\% of the Area Median Income (AMI). I then run regression models to determine the local characteristics most strongly associated with larger affordability gaps, with a focus on whether housing subsidies are effective at combating such gaps. Rental affordability gaps became more pronounced during the Great Recession. In nearly 70\% of the counties in my sample, there was an increase from 2007 to 2010 in the number of ELI households per affordable rental unit. Across the country, the increase was 17\%, a dramatic increase in only three years.

The underlying assumption in most of these studies is that the couples applying for a mortgage are ethno-racially homogenous.

  abstract = {A quantitative understanding of aquifer water budgets is critical for effective, long-term water management. Water budgets can be directly calculated assuming that sufficient data are available. However, water budgets are now much more commonly implicitly evaluated as part of numerical surface-water and groundwater models or integrated surface-water/groundwater models. Nevertheless, development of accurate conceptual models, and in turn, numerical models of hydrologic systems requires knowledge of the main components of their water budgets and their magnitudes.},

  abstract = {Objective: To analyze type II diabetes mortality rates geographic distribution and evolution in time across both Mexican border regions during the period 1998-2013. Methods: The work is based on exploratory and inferential data analysis conducted using death reports from the national health information system. The analysis considers social determinants of health as a theoretical paradigm and includes microdata on consumption patterns at household level for the US-Mexico and Mexico- Guatemala border states. Results: A convergence path for type II diabetes mortality rates is found during the last 15 years between the studied border regions. Conclusions: The evidence presented indicates that the southern border states had been experiencing an epidemiologic transition towards mortality causes such as type II diabetes in the last decade. A trajectory that reflects a convergence pattern towards mortality rates found in the northern border states. Objetivo: Analizar la distribución geográfica y evolución temporal de las tasas de mortalidad por diabetes tipo II en el periodo 1998-2013 para las regiones frontera sur y norte de México. Métodos: el trabajo se basa en el análisis exploratorio e inferencial de datos a partir de los registros de mortalidad reportados por el sistema nacional de información en salud SINAIS. El análisis retoma el paradigma teórico sobre determinantes sociales de salud por lo que se consideran microdatos sobre los patrones de consumo a nivel hogar en el contexto de la frontera México-Estados Unidos y México-Guatemala. Resultados: Se encuentra una trayectoria de convergencia durante los últimos 15 años en las tasas de mortalidad por diabetes tipo II entre las dos regiones fronterizas estudiadas. Conclusiones: La evidencia presentada indica que los estados de la frontera sur han experimentado en la última década una transición epidemiológica hacia causas de mortalidad como la diabetes tipo II, una trayectoria que muestra un patrón de convergencia con la población en la frontera norte.},

The cost surface, representing impedance to transport illicit drugs, is modeled by considering physical, socio-demographic, and drug violence factors. The impedance is then transferred to the road network to represent the cost for moving drugs along the roads, which becomes the main input for network analysis. The results from the routes simulation confirm largely the known territory divisions and the drug trafficking routes of the major Mexican drug organizations. The findings help us understand the development of drug trafficking routes in Mexico, which can potentially enhance our capability to predict the dynamics of drug smuggling routes.},

The impedance is then transferred to the road network to represent the cost for moving drugs along the roads, which becomes the main input for network analysis. The results from the routes simulation confirm largely the known territory divisions and the drug trafficking routes of the major Mexican drug organizations. The findings help us understand the development of drug trafficking routes in Mexico, which can potentially enhance our capability to predict the dynamics of drug smuggling routes.},

  abstract = {"This paper examines the history of internal migration in the United States since the 1980s. By most measures, internal migration in the United States is at a 30-year low. The widespread decline in migration rates across a large number of subpopulations suggests that broad-based economic forces are likely responsible for the decrease. An obvious question is the extent to which the recent housing market contraction and the recession may have caused this downward trend in migration: after all, relocation activity often involves both housing market activity and changes in employment. However, we find relatively small roles for both of these cyclical factors. While we will suggest a few other possible explanations for the recent decrease in migration, the puzzle remains. Finally, we compare U.S. migration to other developed countries. Despite the steady decline in U.S. migration, the commonly held belief that Americans are more mobile than their European counterparts still appears to hold true." (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku).

  abstract = {Marx’s concept of metabolic rift has emerged as an important category in ecological Marxism, but has received relatively little attention in political ecology. This appears to reflect a combination of confusion regarding the conceptual basis of metabolic rift and theoretical antagonisms between its materialist dialectic and dominant post-humanist approaches in hybridist political ecology. In this essay, we argue that stronger engagement with metabolic-rift scholarship in political ecology could strengthen work in both areas. We briefly outline the possibilities for such engagement by first clarifying some of the conceptual confusion regarding the metabolic rift and its material-dialectical approach to human alienation and the socio-ecological contradictions and crises of capital accumulation and human development within capitalism. We then briefly discuss some of the key points of contention between this approach and dominant hybridist paradigms in political ecology. We conclude that, despite these conflicts, the concept of metabolic rift could provide essential critical contributions to political ecology's explanatory and emancipatory efforts.},

  abstract = {Marx’s concept of metabolic rift has emerged as an important category in ecological Marxism, but has received relatively little attention in political ecology. This appears to reflect a combination of confusion regarding the conceptual basis of metabolic rift and theoretical antagonisms between its materialist dialectic and dominant post-humanist approaches in hybridist political ecology. In this essay, we argue that stronger engagement with metabolic-rift scholarship in political ecology could strengthen work in both areas. We briefly outline the possibilities for such engagement by first clarifying some of the conceptual confusion regarding the metabolic rift and its material-dialectical approach to human alienation and the socio-ecological contradictions and crises of capital accumulation and human development within capitalism. We then briefly discuss some of the key points of contention between this approach and dominant hybridist paradigms in political ecology. We conclude that, despite these conflicts, the concept of metabolic rift could provide essential critical contributions to political ecology's explanatory and emancipatory efforts.},

These differences may be attributable to different methodological problems and to the lack of operational definitions. Several studies suggest that the prevalence of allergic diseases has been increasing worldwide in recent years. However, in Mexico, there is no data in open population. Objective: To know in open population the prevalence of allergic diseases in the counties of Mexico City, the frequence of symptoms in each allergic disease, the therapeutic modalities that patients seek, the school and work annual absences and the amount of money that each patient spends in antiallergic drugs. Patients and methods: It was an open-population, cross-sectional trial, in two phases with a random sample size of 8,000 individuals from 214 public health centers. Statistical analysis was made with Excel 97-2004: Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and chi-square-test for discrete variables, p {$<$} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The prevalence of allergic diseases in Mexico City was 42.6\%, allergic rhinitis was the most frequent. Children are the largest age group affected. The highest prevalence was found in Tlahuac county. Coexistence of allergic diseases was found in 19.9\%. The 44.2\% of allergic patients attended to their general practitioner. 20.4\% of all patients spent 10-20\% of their income in medicines and 26\% do not have money to buy antiallergic drugs.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The growing homeless population in the U.S.A. is disproportionately impacted by poor mental and physical health status, including a higher incidence  of acute and chronic health problems, increased hospitalizations, and premature  mortality compared to the general population. This study examined the association  between demographic, social, and clinical factors and perceptions of general  health status among the homeless population during admission to an integrated  behavioral health treatment program. METHODS: The study sample included 331  adults experiencing homelessness with a serious mental illness or co-occurring  disorder. Participants were enrolled in services at a day program for unsheltered  homeless adults, a residential substance use treatment program for males  experiencing homelessness, a psychiatric step-down respite program for those  experiencing homelessness following psychiatric hospitalization, permanent  supportive housing for formerly chronically homeless adults, a faith-based food  distribution program, and homeless encampment sites in a large urban area.  Participants were interviewed using The Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration's National Outcome Measures tool and a validated  health-related quality of life measurement tool, SF-36. Data were examined using  in elastic net regression. RESULTS: The study found seven factors to be  particularly strong predictors of SF-36 general health scores.~Male gender,  "other" sexual identity, stimulant use, and Asian race were all associated with  better perceptions of health status, while transgender status, inhalant use, and  number of times arrested were associated with poorer perceptions. CONCLUSION:  This study suggests targeted areas for health screening within the homeless  population; however, more studies are necessary to demonstrate generalizability  of the results.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The growing homeless population in the U.S.A. is disproportionately impacted by poor mental and physical health status, including a higher incidence of acute and chronic health problems, increased hospitalizations, and premature mortality compared to the general population. This study examined the association between demographic, social, and clinical factors and perceptions of general health status among the homeless population during admission to an integrated behavioral health treatment program. METHODS: The study sample included 331 adults experiencing homelessness with a serious mental illness or co-occurring disorder. Participants were enrolled in services at a day program for unsheltered homeless adults, a residential substance use treatment program for males experiencing homelessness, a psychiatric step-down respite program for those experiencing homelessness following psychiatric hospitalization, permanent supportive housing for formerly chronically homeless adults, a faith-based food distribution program, and homeless encampment sites in a large urban area. Participants were interviewed using The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Outcome Measures tool and a validated health-related quality of life measurement tool, SF-36. Data were examined using in elastic net regression. RESULTS: The study found seven factors to be particularly strong predictors of SF-36 general health scores. Male gender, "other" sexual identity, stimulant use, and Asian race were all associated with better perceptions of health status, while transgender status, inhalant use, and number of times arrested were associated with poorer perceptions. CONCLUSION: This study suggests targeted areas for health screening within the homeless population; however, more studies are necessary to demonstrate generalizability of the results.},

This paper presents a comprehensive test of the alternate hypothesis that variations in homelessness arise from changed circumstances in the housing market and in the income distribution. We assemble essentially all the systematic information available on homelessness in U.S. urban areas: census counts, shelter bed counts, records of transfer payments, and administrative agency estimates. We estimate similar statistical models using four different samples of data on the incidence of homelessness, defined according to very different criteria. Our results suggest that simple economic principles governing the availability and pricing of housing and the growth in demand for the lowest-quality housing explain a large portion of the variation in homelessness among U.S. metropolitan housing markets. Furthermore, rather modest improvements in the affordability of rental housing or its availability can substantially reduce the incidence of homelessness in the United States.]}

Compared with heavy metal concentrations in selected cities around the world, As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations in urban soils of Isfahan are relatively enriched. Moreover, natural background concentrations of Co, Cr and Ni in Isfahan province soil are high and the apparent enrichment relative to other major cities of the world is due to this high background contents. Calculated contamination factor (CF) confirmed that As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn are extremely enriched in the urban soils.

An industrial process for manufacturing infant food using quinoa as a basic raw material is being developed. The presence of antinutrients are of importance in this context, and this paper deals with saponins, phytic acid, tannins and protease inhibitors in quinoa seeds. The samples of quinoa analysed in this experiment contained two main types of saponins. The amount of saponin A (β-d-glucopyranosyl-[β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-α-l-arabino-pyranosyl-(1 → 3)]-3-β-23-dihydroxy-12-en-28-oate methyl ester) was 0·7\% of the dry weight and that of the saponin B (β-d-glucopyranosyl-[β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-α-l-arabino-pyranosyl-(1 → 3)]-3-β-23-dihydroxyolcan-12-en-28-oate was 0·2\% of the dry weight. These were the major saponins found in the quinoa bran collected while polishing the seeds. After scrubbing and washing, the level of saponin-A remaining in the seeds decreased to 0·31\% of the dry weight, and saponin-B was completely removed by this process. The content of phytic acid in the quinoa seeds was about 1\% of the dry matter, and scrubbing and washing reduced the phytic acid content of the seeds by about 30\%. Neither protease inhibitor nor tannins were detected in the quinoa seeds.}

  abstract = {This article is a case study of population growth and composition in the Southern California-Baja California trans-border urban system (TBS). The central question guiding the research is how the combination of geographic proximity and economic integration in two very different regions affects population characteristics in the Southern California-Baja California TBS. We begin by briefly defining trans-border urban systems. We then specify the attributes of the Southern California-Baja California TBS, contrasting them with attributes observed elsewhere in the United States and Mexico. We particularly emphasize the impact of the Mexican-origin population on population growth, composition, age structure and trans-border mobility. We conclude by outlining several national and international policy implications that can be derived from a regional focus on the Southern California-Baja California TBS. The units of analysis are the aggregate TBS and the component counties and municipios. The data are drawn primarily from the U.S. and Mexican censuses. Secondary data from a variety of sources also are discussed.}

The program was carried out jointly in 1990 by U.S. and Mexican institutions. The results show pollution problems due to deficiencies in Nogales, Sonora municipal sewerage system, causing not only sewage spills in several parts of the city but also creating occasional transboundary problems. The results also showed potential illegal dumping of industrial hazardous waste (VOCs) into Nogales' municipal sewerage system. All of the organic compounds found in the sewage samples are solvents frequently used by the border industry. Occasional brakes of pipes spill the pollutants into the Nogales Wash, a water stream that runs parallel to Nogales' main sewerage line. Samples of the municipal water system showed no traces of pollutants. However, two rounds of samples detected concentrations of VOCs in wells used to supply water by trucks to low income neighborhoods in Nogales, Sonora. Ironically, the pollution detected in these wells has a greater impact in low income groups of the city that pay three to four times more per liter of water they consume, than the rest of the inhabitants with clean water from the municipal system.}

In this paper we challenge this view by showing how technological artefacts are scripted or coded by human agency, social norms on right and wrong, and power relationships, and how they, in turn, ‘structure’ or ‘mediate’ the moral actions and decisions of human beings. We discuss at length what technology is, how its designs are inherently social, and how the social coordination of labour as well as technology’s replicability are central for it to emerge and exist. Through a case study about tank irrigation in India, we demonstrate how the moral agency of maintaining a certain social order in the tank-irrigated area was delegated to technological designs of sluices, waste weirs, and other discharge structures, but also to the layout of canals, and the landscape of the command area. Precisely this delegation of the reproduction of social order to material structures allowed the sustaining of differentiated power relations over a long period of time. In conclusion, we claim that our argument has much larger relevance for the politics of water control technology, even for mega-technology such as large dams. We claim that engineers and planners not only shape material designs of water control structures but that they implicitly ’materialize morality’. In that sense, re-organizing water rights and re-distributing water resources is not merely a matter of redressing institutional policy frameworks but equally involves re-moralizing and re-politicizing the very material technological artefacts.},

The complex natural variability of the rainfall-driven streamflow events introduces a water resources management challenge for the region. In this study, we assessed the impact of projected climate change on regional water resources management. We analyzed climate change projections of precipitation for the Upper Santa Cruz River from eight dynamically downscaled Global Circulation Models (GCMs). Our analysis indicates an increase (decrease) in the frequency of occurrence of dry (wet) summers. The winter rainfall projections indicate an increased frequency of both dry and wet winter seasons, which implies lower chance for medium-precipitation winters. The climate analysis results were also compared with resampled coarse GCMs and bias adjusted and statistically downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections readily available for the contiguous U.S. The impact of the projected climatic change was assessed through a water resources management case study. The hydrologic framework utilized includes a rainfall generator of likely scenarios and a series of hydrologic models that estimate the groundwater recharge and the change in groundwater storage. We conclude that climatic change projections increase the uncertainty and further exacerbate the already complicated water resources management task. The ability to attain an annual water supply goal, the accrued annual water deficit and the potential for replenishment of the aquifer depend considerably on the selected management regime.},

  abstract = {Abstract The emergent crisis of affordable urban housing coupled with a sustained decline in internal migration rates in many Western countries warrants a thorough exploration of the relation between housing costs and internal migration. Although it is well established that housing is an important contextual determinant of migration flows, little attention has thus far been paid to the ways in which rising housing costs shape internal migration. In this paper, we use a time-series of annual intercounty migration in Germany for the period 2004–2017 to examine the association between increasing housing prices and changes in internal migration flows. For this, we apply fixed effects Poisson panel regression models to migration flow tables. Our results show that regions with rising housing costs experience declining inflows. In larger cities, rising housing costs are also associated with increasing outflows. Our study provides new insights into the relationship between house price dynamics and internal migration.},

  abstract = {Even though the Chilean economy has experienced a sustained economic growth and made enormous progress in reducing poverty in the last 25years, its income inequality continues to be among the highest in the world. Given its importance, the literature has paid considerable attention to income inequality in Chile. Nevertheless, all of the existing studies use a cross-section distribution of earnings when analyzing inequality. Cross-section and lifetime measures of inequality are different. While the latter reflects long run resources available to individuals, the former does not. This emphasizes the dynamic dimension of inequality. This paper focuses on the analysis of income inequality from a lifetime perspective for the Chilean economy using a search-theoretic framework. The model, which is structurally estimated with Chilean data, captures the dynamic of the labor market of male workers actively participating in the market and is used to simulate careers to construct lifetime measures of inequality. The results indicate that inequality is not only high in a cross-section perspective, but also in a lifetime perspective; and that low mobility is the main source of lifetime inequality in the Chilean labor market. Hence, regulation of the labor market matters because it affects the degree of mobility in the market.},

Study design This was a nationally representative survey. Methods Using a sample of 1004 low-income veterans in 2021, this study examined the lifetime prevalence and characteristics associated with eviction, home foreclosure, and homelessness among low-income US veterans. Results In the total sample, 10.9\% reported a lifetime history of eviction, 8.0\% reported a lifetime history of home foreclosure, and 19.9\% reported a lifetime history of homelessness. Among those with a history of homelessness, 39.2\% also reported a history of eviction, and 13.9\% reported a history of home foreclosure. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses found that for eviction, sociodemographic characteristics (e.g. being Hispanic, having private insurance, and being from the Northeast was associated with lower risk of eviction) together explained 26\% of the variance, and clinical characteristics explained an incremental 12\% additional variance. For homelessness, sociodemographic characteristics explained 18\% of the variance, and clinical characteristics explained an incremental 20\% (e.g. diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, any history of suicide attempt, and lower physical health scores were associated with higher risk of homelessness). For home foreclosure, sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial variables together only explained 14\% of the variance. Conclusion Evictions, home foreclosures, and homelessness are discrete events and occur at relatively high rates among low-income veterans. In addition, homelessness was more associated with biosocial dysfunction, whereas eviction was more closely associated with socio-economic vulnerability, which may inform intervention efforts for both events.},

  abstract = {Indigenous populations of the Americas experienced high mortality rates during the early contact period as a result of infectious diseases, many of which were introduced by Europeans. Most of the pathogenic agents that caused these outbreaks remain unknown. Through the introduction of a new metagenomic analysis tool called MALT, applied here to search for traces of ancient pathogen DNA, we were able to identify Salmonella enterica in individuals buried in an early contact era epidemic cemetery at Teposcolula-Yucundaa, Oaxaca in southern Mexico. This cemetery is linked, based on historical and archaeological evidence, to the 1545–1550\,ce epidemic that affected large parts of Mexico. Locally, this epidemic was known as ‘cocoliztli’, the pathogenic cause of which has been debated for more than a century. Here, we present genome-wide data from ten individuals for Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi C, a bacterial cause of enteric fever. We propose that S.\,Paratyphi C be considered a strong candidate for the epidemic population decline during the 1545 cocoliztli outbreak at Teposcolula-Yucundaa.}

The current paper presents the Interpersonal Theory of Suicidal Behavior. We propose that the most dangerous form of suicidal desire is caused by the simultaneous presence of two interpersonal constructs—thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness (and hopelessness about these states)—and further, that the capability to engage in suicidal behavior is separate from the desire to engage in suicidal behavior. According to the theory, the capability for suicidal behavior emerges, via habituation and opponent processes, in response to repeated exposure to physically painful and/or fear-inducing experiences. In the current paper, the theory’s hypotheses are more precisely delineated than in previous presentations (Joiner, 2005), with the aim of inviting scientific inquiry and potential falsification of the theory’s hypotheses.}

  abstract = {In the 1920s some 3,800 Mennonites who had settled in Manitoba in the 1870s left their farms to migrate to the Bustillos Valley of northern Mexico. While conflict over education was the main stimulus for the move, this paper argues that the migration also offered an opportunity to restore the system of land tenure Mennonites had practiced in Imperial Russia. Conservative Mennonites had reified a tsarist-imposed system of semi-communal land tenure, making it a requirement of faithful religious and social practice. These sensibilities were, however, incompatible with the land tenure system of the new Dominion of Canada giving rise to tension and conflict. When migration became a reality, conservative Mennonites sought to reestablish the colony and village tenure systemby seeking a block sale of their individual lands in Manitoba and by purchasing land in Mexico under colony title, thereby restoring semi-communal land tenure.}

  abstract = {In the 1920s some 3,800 Mennonites who had settled in Manitoba in the 1870s left their farms to migrate to the Bustillos Valley of northern Mexico. While conflict over education was the main stimulus for the move, this paper argues that the migration also offered an opportunity to restore the system of land tenure Mennonites had practiced in Imperial Russia. Conservative Mennonites had reified a tsarist-imposed system of semi-communal land tenure, making it a requirement of faithful religious and social practice. These sensibilities were, however, incompatible with the land tenure system of the new Dominion of Canada giving rise to tension and conflict. When migration became a reality, conservative Mennonites sought to reestablish the colony and village tenure systemby seeking a block sale of their individual lands in Manitoba and by purchasing land in Mexico under colony title, thereby restoring semi-communal land tenure.}

The premier application is to the study of the effects of investment in schooling and on-the-job training on the level, pattern, and interpersonal distribution of life cycle earnings associated with the pioneering work on human capital by several mentioned scholars. The chapter is devoted to the theoretical and empirical development of the human capital earnings function during the past 25 years. The chapter surveys the empirical estimates of the rate of return to education and the pattern of life cycle earnings. The chapter discusses the derivation of human capital earnings functions under the assumption of homogenous human capital and introduces the model of heterogeneous human capital described. The chapter considers theoretical and econometric issues, which arise when there is inequality of opportunity and ability and closes with a discussion of empirical findings concerning ability bias. The chapter also describes some recent literature on several topics such as signalling, implicit contracts, and specific human capital, which extend or modify certain aspects of the human capital model.}
