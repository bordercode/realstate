  abstract = {Objective: To analyze type II diabetes mortality rates geographic distribution and evolution in time across both Mexican border regions during the period 1998-2013. Methods: The work is based on exploratory and inferential data analysis conducted using death reports from the national health information system. The analysis considers social determinants of health as a theoretical paradigm and includes microdata on consumption patterns at household level for the US-Mexico and Mexico- Guatemala border states. Results: A convergence path for type II diabetes mortality rates is found during the last 15 years between the studied border regions. Conclusions: The evidence presented indicates that the southern border states had been experiencing an epidemiologic transition towards mortality causes such as type II diabetes in the last decade. A trajectory that reflects a convergence pattern towards mortality rates found in the northern border states. Objetivo: Analizar la distribución geográfica y evolución temporal de las tasas de mortalidad por diabetes tipo II en el periodo 1998-2013 para las regiones frontera sur y norte de México. Métodos: el trabajo se basa en el análisis exploratorio e inferencial de datos a partir de los registros de mortalidad reportados por el sistema nacional de información en salud SINAIS. El análisis retoma el paradigma teórico sobre determinantes sociales de salud por lo que se consideran microdatos sobre los patrones de consumo a nivel hogar en el contexto de la frontera México-Estados Unidos y México-Guatemala. Resultados: Se encuentra una trayectoria de convergencia durante los últimos 15 años en las tasas de mortalidad por diabetes tipo II entre las dos regiones fronterizas estudiadas. Conclusiones: La evidencia presentada indica que los estados de la frontera sur han experimentado en la última década una transición epidemiológica hacia causas de mortalidad como la diabetes tipo II, una trayectoria que muestra un patrón de convergencia con la población en la frontera norte.},

El conocimiento de las variables físicas y antropogénicas de una cuenca hidrográfica, sumado al marco legal aplicable, permiten el manejo integrado de la misma con el objetivo de preservar y asegurar la sustentabilidad del ambiente. El estudio de cuencas hídricas en Argentina es poco y por ello en este trabajo se analiza el marco legal aplicado al manejo de cuencas hídricas en referencia a la cuenca del río Gualjaina. Tanto desde el aspecto institucional como normativo, la gestión de las cuencas en la provincia de Chubut tiende a la integralidad, a través de la coordinación de instituciones como el Instituto Provincial del Agua junto con la participación local, representada a través de los consorcios, la comunidad educativa y los medios de información. Gualjaina river, an affluent of the Chubut River, located in the Patagonia Argentina, develops a drainage basin of about 2800 km2. The knowledge of the physical and anthropogenic variables of a river basin, plus the applicable legal framework, aloud the integrated watershed management with the objective of preserve and enforce the environmental sustainability. The researches of the Argentinean drainage basin are scarce and for that, this paper fosters to analyze the legal framework applied to the management of drainage basins focused on the Gualjaina river. Therefore, from the institutional as from the legal aspects, the management of watershed in Chubut province tends to the integrality, through the coordination of the institutions as the “Instituto Provincial del Agua” beside the participation of local people represented through consortiums (“Consorcios”), the educative community and the information media.},

  abstract = {[BACKGROUND Short-term forecasts of international migration are often based on data that are incomplete, biased, and reported with delays. There is also a scarcity of migration forecasts based on combined traditional and new forms of data. OBJECTIVE This research assessed an inclusive approach of supplementing official migration statistics, typically reported with a delay, with the so-called big data from Google searches to produce short-term forecasts (“now-casts”) of immigration flows from Romania to the United Kingdom. METHODS Google Trends data were used to create composite variables depicting the general interest of Romanians in migrating into the United Kingdom. These variables were then assessed as predictors and compared with benchmark results by using univariate time series models. RESULTS The proposed Google Trends indices related to employment and education, which exhaust all possible keywords and eliminate language bias, match trends observed in the migration statistics. They are also capable of moderate reductions in prediction errors. CONCLUSIONS Google Trends data have some potential to indicate up-to-date current trends of interest in mobility, which may serve as useful predictors of sudden changes in migration. However, these data do not always improve the accuracy of forecasts. The usability of Google Trends is also limited to short-term migration forecasting and requires understanding of contexts surrounding origin and destination countries. CONTRIBUTION This work provides an example on combining Google Trends and official migration data to produce short-term forecasts, illustrated with flows from Romania to the UK. It also discusses caveats and suggests future work for using these data in migration forecasting.]}

  abstract = {Growing world population and the uncertain hazards that accompany climate change put an increasing pressure on the management and sustainability of scarce environmental resources, notably water. In spite of its water scarcity, the state of Arizona permits as much as 73\% of its water to be consumed by a single sector, crop production. Since 79\% of such crop production is not consumed in Arizona, it corresponds to exporting up to 67\% of the water available in the state to the rest of the country and abroad. It has certain and glooming consequences on the availability of water for a state expected to see its population grow and its climate get drier. Based on input-output techniques, we simulate three scenarios aiming at saving 19\% of the water available, a figure set by the first of them based on improving the efficiency of the current irrigation system. The same savings could also be reached by a twenty-seven-fold increase in the price of water or a 19.5\% reduction in crop exports. Estimates indicate that the least costly solution is a more efficient irrigation system while export reduction is the second-best choice.},

  abstract = {The world’s largest deposits of lithium lie in brines found underneath salt flats in the desert between Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Globally, lithium may reduce fossil fuel use by making batteries for cars and renewable energy storage more affordable. This article analyzes ongoing debates about lithium in these three countries to identify what hopes, fears and expectations different stakeholders are bringing to debates about lithium. My approach builds on the idea of resource imaginaries, particularly the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries that highlights the importance of science and technology to projections of desirable futures. I analyze the tensions, visions and metaphors used by different stakeholders, including activists, the media, and state and industry officials, to imagine and thus legitimate lithium extraction. This study finds three co-existing positions in these debates: lithium as a commodity, as a strategic resource or as the subject of a sociotechnical imaginary. Chile, Argentina and Bolivia are converging on the last of these, best described as a reimagining of the relationship between mining and development in which lithium, through innovation and industry, will redefine the relationship between Latin American economies and global markets. This imaginary projects a binary between raw and industrial materials and deterministically assumes that science and technology will transform the former into the latter. Disagreements and challenges notwithstanding, the article argues that this imaginary is evidence of a crisis of confidence in development that is creating space for a more dynamic debate about the social value of mining and the proper role of the state in development. This convergence will have also implications for how sustainable, equitable and reliable lithium production will be.},

Many studies have searched for a direct causal relationship between economic hardship and suicide, however, findings have been varied.Method. Suicide data was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the period between January 1968 and August 2002. These were correlated with a suite of macroeconomic data including housing loan interest rates, unemployment rates, days lost to industrial disputes, Consumer Price Index, gross domestic product, and the Consumer Sentiment Index.Results. A total of 51845 males and 16327 females committed suicide between these dates. There were significant associations between suicide rates and eleven macroeconomic indicators for both genders in at least one age range. Data was divided into male and female and five age ranges and pooled ages. Analyses were conducted on these 132 datasets resulting in 80 significant findings. The data was generally stronger for indices measuring economic performance than indices measuring consumers' perceptions of the state of the economy. A striking difference between male and female trends was seen. Generally, male suicide rates increased with markers of economic adversity, while the opposite pattern was seen in females. There were significantly different patterns in age-stratified data, with for example higher housing loan interest rates having a positive association with suicide in younger people and a negative association in older age groups.Conclusion. Macroeconomic trends are significantly associated with suicide. The patterns in males and females are very different, and there are further substantial age-related differences.}

  abstract = {This paper uses a unique dataset to examine the economics of cross-border drug smuggling. Our results reveal that loads are generally quite large (median 30kg), but with substantial variance within and across drug types. Males and females, as well as U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens are all well represented among mules. We also find that mule compensation is substantial (median \$1313), and varies with load characteristics. Specifically, for mules caught with cocaine and meth, pay appears to be strongly correlated to expected sentence if caught, while pay appears to be primarily correlated with load size for marijuana mules, who generally smuggle much larger loads than those smuggling cocaine and meth. We argue that our results suggest that this underground labor market generally acts like a competitive labor market, where a risk-sensitive, reasonably well-informed, and relatively elastic labor force is compensated for higher risk tasks.},

  abstract = {Water conflicts are increasingly spilling into the streets in Chile, as communities struggle to make their voices heard in formal decision-making forums. However, these growing social movements are doing much more than just marching. Combining insights from political ecology and legal geography, this article approaches water governance as a complex field of struggle in which social movement resistance plays a crucial role. In the case of the Alto Maipo hydropower conflict in central Chile, social movement actors have taken on a wide range of roles that they feel should correspond to the state: monitoring the hydropower company, documenting citizen concerns, and demanding accountability from government agencies. Attention to the legal dimensions of this struggle reveals how this work of “subsidizing the state” was built into the new institutional order ushered in during the Pinochet dictatorship, and how the capacity of social movement actors to mold this space to their advantage has been restricted by the legal framework for water governance. While there has been considerable attention to the role of resistance from water user associations in reshaping neoliberal water reforms in other parts of Latin America, the Chilean case highlights the need to also consider social movement actors from outside of the conventional water sector who struggle to defend in-stream uses not recognized under the law. Faced with limited legal recourse in the courts and little legitimacy in decision-making forums, Chilean activists have pursued alternative strategies that have expanded the scope of their resistance and built broader political pressure for change.},

  abstract = {Homelessness has long been recognised as a global phenomenon, affecting poorer populations in both the developed and developing worlds. However, acute housing need has often struggled to achieve the same level of priority at an international level as the satisfaction of other basic needs, such as for food, water, healthcare and education. In this paper we present a broad-based Global Homelessness Framework as a means of providing a ‘frame of reference’ for cross-national engagement in this field, but recommend that concerted international action focuses on a relatively narrow definition of homelessness encompassing people without any form of accommodation (the ‘unsheltered’ group who are sleeping rough or in places not intended for human habitation) and those living in temporary or crisis accommodation specifically provided for homeless people. We demonstrate that current data is insufficient to generate a comprehensive and defensible worldwide ‘count’ of homeless people, and set out proposals to facilitate moves towards more reliable homelessness estimates at local, national and global levels. At the same time, however, we argue that at least some meaningful trend data is already available for large parts of the Global North, and for some countries and cities in the Global South, so that it would be both feasible and valuable to systematically track these ‘directions of travel’ over time.},

  abstract = {Study Region This study region encompasses the Transboundary San Pedro and Santa Cruz aquifers which are shared between the states of Sonora (Mexico) and Arizona (US). Special regional considerations include a semi-arid climate, basin-fill aquifers with predominantly montane recharge areas, economic drivers in the mining, trade, and military sectors, groundwater-dependent cities with expanding cones of depression, interbasin groundwater transfers, ground- and surface-water contamination, and protected aquatic and riparian habitats that act as significant migration corridors for hundreds of species, including some that are threatened and endangered. Study Focus We focus on lessons learned from the hydrologic assessment of the Transboundary San Pedro and Santa Cruz aquifers. We conducted the work, in two phases: (1) laying the groundwork and (2) implementation. The “laying the groundwork” phase consisted of binational meetings with stakeholders and key actors (agencies and individuals), and the development of an understanding of the physical, institutional, historical, and socio-political context. This led to signing of the binational Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Program (TAAP) agreement in 2009 and detailed the process for cooperation and coordination in the assessment of shared aquifers. The implementation phase began with an agreement to proceed with the study of four “focus” aquifers (Santa Cruz, San Pedro, Mesilla (Conejos-Médanos in Mexico), and Hueco Bolson (Bolsón del Hueco in Mexico)) and development of associated technical teams. Though we do include a brief discussion of the lessons learned from the physical science portion of the study, the results have been described and published elsewhere. The bulk of the paper instead focuses on the findings and lessons learned from the integration of social-science perspectives into a largely physical-science based program, since there is a growing recognition of the need for this type of approach especially in the management and assessment of transboundary aquifers. New Hydrological Insights for the Region The Sonora-Arizona effort succeeded because both countries were adequately represented, and because of flexibility of skills and ability of teams comprising both university and government scientists. Teams included social and earth scientists. Including the social sciences was critical to research design and implementation, and to addressing the cultural, institutional, and socio-political contexts of transboundary aquifer assessment. Significant components of the continuing implementation phase include strategic planning, data compilation and analysis, cross-border integration of datasets, geophysical and geochemical surveys, and internal, peer, and stakeholder engagement.},

  abstract = {In the beer market, changes in demand are playing a pivotal role for future sectoral dynamics. Beer drinkers are increasingly seeking new tastes, experiencing different consumption situations and food matching, and demonstrating willingness to pay for superior quality products. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze the recent scientific literature investigating beer demand and beer consumer perceptions and preferences. Using a systematic review, we found 65 journal articles—indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases and published in the period from 2010 to 2019—analyzing beer consumer perceptions and preferences. We observed an increasing interest in recent years among scholars in studying beer consumption from a marketing perspective, especially in the case of craft and premium beer. Studies during the last decade have identified a significant number of determinants characterizing (craft) beer consumption. Sociodemographic characteristics are considered one of the main market segmentation factors, mainly in terms of age, gender, and lifestyle. Among other individual factors, involvement in beer, familiarity with beers and brands, and consumer knowledge of beers and frequency of consumption play a focal role. Moreover, consumption situations and occasions are relevant segmentation variables. Consumer perceptions of new styles of beer and speciality beers (such as sustainable or organic beer) require additional attention from scholars and market analysts. They potentially represent factors generating further differentiation strategies in the beer market for the future. Thus there is a need for further research in this field, along with more cross-country analysis, to better understand beer market particularities and allow beer businesses to meet the multiple expectations of beer consumers.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between international trade of avocado and the related virtual water trade over the period 2000–2016. Using a Physical Trade Analysis, we show that commercial and virtual water trade grew rapidly moving almost hand-in-hand in the years taken into account: in parallel with a remarkable increase of international trade of avocado from 0.4 Mt in 2000 to 1.9 Mt in 2016, the global virtual water trade of avocado increased from 408 Mm3 to 2238 Mm3 over the same period. The analysis emphasizes a large disparity between developed and developing countries, with the former being net importer of water and the latter large net exporter. In particular, large avocado-related water flows move from countries already under chronic water stress such as Mexico, Peru and Chile towards more water-rich regions such as US, Japan, Canada and the European Union. As a consequence, the overexploitation of water underlying the avocado trade flows may end up worsening environmental conditions in many relatively poor countries in which the export of avocado is often regarded as an important source of economic growth.},

  abstract = {Background Mexican-born children living in the United States have a lower prevalence of asthma than other US children. Although children of Mexican descent near the Arizona (AZ)-Sonora border are genetically similar, differences in environmental exposures might result in differences in asthma prevalence across this region. Objective The objective of this study was to determine if the prevalence of asthma and wheeze in these children varies across the AZ-Sonora border. Methods The International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Children written and video questionnaires were administered to 1753 adolescents from 5 middle schools: Tucson (school A), Nogales, AZ (schools B, C), and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico (schools D, E). The prevalence of asthma and symptoms was compared, with analyses in the AZ schools limited to self-identified Mexican American students. Results Compared with the Sonoran reference school E, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for asthma was significantly higher in US schools A (OR 4.89, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.72-8.80), B (OR 3.47, 95\% CI 1.88-6.42), and C (OR 4.12, 95\% CI 1.78-9.60). The adjusted OR for wheeze in the past year was significantly higher in schools A (OR 2.19, 95\% CI 1.20-4.01) and B (OR 2.67, 95\% CI 1.42-5.01) on the written questionnaire and significantly higher in A (OR 2.13, 95\% CI 1.22-3.75), B (OR 1.95, 95\% CI 1.07-3.53), and Sonoran school D (OR 2.34, 95\% CI 1.28-4.30) on the video questionnaire compared with school E. Conclusions Asthma and wheeze prevalence differed significantly between schools and was higher in the United States. Environmental factors that may account for these differences could provide insight into mechanisms of protection from asthma.},

Through a narrative analysis, we identify how political ecology can develop our future agendas for neighborhood-health research as it relates to social, political, environmental, and economic structures. Political ecology makes clear the connection between political economy and neighborhood by highlighting the historical and structural processes that produce and maintain social inequality, which affect health and well-being. These concepts encourage researchers to examine how people construct neighborhood and health in different ways that, in turn, can influence different health outcomes and, thus, efforts to address solutions.},

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with follow-up from 1976 to 1990. SETTING: 11 U.S. states. PARTICIPANTS: 114,281 female registered nurses aged 30 to 55 years who did not have diagnosed diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer in 1976. OUTCOME MEASURES: Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: 2204 cases of diabetes were diagnosed during 1.49 million person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for age, body mass index was the dominant predictor of risk for diabetes mellitus. Risk increased with greater body mass index, and even women with average weight (body mass index, 24.0 kg/m2) had an elevated risk. Compared  with women with stable weight (those who gained or lost less than 5 kg between age 18 years and 1976) and after adjustment for age and body mass index at age 18 years, the relative risk for diabetes mellitus among women who had a weight gain  of 5.0 to 7.9 kg was 1.9 (95\% CI, 1.5 to 2.3). The corresponding relative risk for women who gained 8.0 to 10.9 kg was 2.7 (CI, 2.1 to 3.3). In contrast, women  who lost more than 5.0 kg reduced their risk for diabetes mellitus by 50\% or more. These results were independent of family history of diabetes. CONCLUSION: The excess risk for diabetes with even modest and typical adult weight gain is substantial. These findings support the importance of maintaining a constant body weight throughout adult life and suggest that the 1990 U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines that allow a substantial weight gain after 35 years of age are misleading.},

En cuanto a daños en la salud de la población, se reportaron numerosas lesiones oculares por proyectiles de impacto cinético y uso de bombas lacrimógenas como proyectiles contra las personas, generando un brote de lesiones oculares inédito en el mundo. Existió un uso excesivo de armas químicas y no se han comunicado todos los químicos utilizados. El impacto en salud mental, sobre todo de la población que vivió en dictadura en los años 1970, es incierto, y la atención de salud se vio desbordada en las áreas geográficas más vulnerables. Es urgente establecer un sistema oportuno y transparente de vigilancia de este tipo de lesiones y conocer todos los compuestos químicos usados como lacrimógenos, así como la composición de los balines y los proyectiles. Chile's October 2019 popular revolt has again made human rights violations visible in the context of mass mobilizations. In terms of damage to the population's health, multiple eye injuries produced by kinetic impact projectiles and tear bombs against people were reported, leading to an outbreak of unpublished eye injuries worldwide. There was excessive use of chemical weapons, and the totality of the chemicals used has not been transparent. The impact on mental health, especially of the population who lived during dictatorship in the 1970s, is uncertain and, health care was overwhelmed in the most vulnerable geographic areas. It is urgent to establish a timely and transparent system for monitoring such lesions and transparent all chemical compounds in tear-tearing and the composition of kinetic impact projectiles.},

Two hundred and twenty-three patients were found to have coccidioidomycosis at our institution from 1994-2002, the largest reported cohort of coccidioidomycosis patients since the 1950s. Of these patients, 58\% presented with isolated pulmonary disease, 14\% had high ({$>$}1:16) complement fixation titers without clear evidence of dissemination, 22\% had definite disseminated disease, and 5\% had unclassified disease. Enzyme immunoassay was a reliable diagnostic tool in those with symptomatic disease, but had a low specificity in those who were asymptomatic. Complement fixation titers of {$>$} or =1:16 were associated with dissemination to bone or skin but were not helpful in evaluating central nervous system disease. Thirteen percent of patients with high complement fixation titers ({$>$}1:16) without clear evidence of dissemination on presentation and 7\% of those with isolated pulmonary disease eventually progressed to disseminated disease; 30\% of Filipino patients with pulmonary disease progressed to disseminated disease. Nonwhite race was a predictor for dissemination; African American patients more often developed disseminated bony disease while Filipinos were more likely to develop cutaneous or central nervous system disease. Relapse of disseminated coccidioidomycosis occurred in 24\% of patients; the risk was highest (71\%) among those with central nervous system disease. Azole therapy was generally inferior to amphotericin B in disseminated disease. Predictors of permanent disability included African American or Filipino race, central nervous system disease, and bony disease.},

Evidence of aquifer recovery after overexploitation is scattered, as is the research on the drivers behind recovery. The Fuencaliente Aquifer in Spain faced a tragedy of the commons situation, but after an innovative governance arrangement was implemented, the aquifer is gradually recovering. In this research, we identify the drivers that made possible the emergence and acceptance of such an arrangement using the social-ecological system framework. We identified external drivers such as market incentives and limited enforcement capacity of the water authority as the main factors that led to groundwater depletion, but we also found that these same drivers, under a new regulatory framework that reinforced monitoring and sanctioning capacities, are the basis for the effective recovery of the aquifer. Internal drivers such as the socioeconomic attributes of the users, their limited collective action and the power differences between traditional and commercial farmers are also critical in explaining the acceptance of the new governance arrangement. Even if these drivers are context-specific, we identified innovations that might be transferable and contribute to the literature on good practices in groundwater governance and management.},

  abstract = {Abstract Water availability is a major factor constraining humanity's ability to meet the future food and energy needs of a growing and increasingly affluent human population. Water plays an important role in the production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become important players in future energy security. The emergent competition for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized in the concept of the “food-energy-water nexus.” The nexus between food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of agriculture and rapid growth in food trade, which results in a massive virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in the food and water security of some regions. This review explores multiple components of the food-energy-water nexus and highlights possible approaches that could be used to meet food and energy security with the limited renewable water resources of the planet. Despite clear tensions inherent in meeting the growing and changing demand for food and energy in the 21st century, the inherent linkages among food, water, and energy systems can offer an opportunity for synergistic strategies aimed at resilient food, water, and energy security, such as the circular economy.},

The central question guiding the research is how the combination of geographic proximity and economic integration in two very different regions affects population characteristics in the Southern California-Baja California TBS. We begin by briefly defining trans-border urban systems. We then specify the attributes of the Southern California-Baja California TBS, contrasting them with attributes observed elsewhere in the United States and Mexico. We particularly emphasize the impact of the Mexican-origin population on population growth, composition, age structure and trans-border mobility. We conclude by outlining several national and international policy implications that can be derived from a regional focus on the Southern California-Baja California TBS. The units of analysis are the aggregate TBS and the component counties and municipios. The data are drawn primarily from the U.S. and Mexican censuses. Secondary data from a variety of sources also are discussed.}

A dominant source is combustion, including fossil fuels. Pollution can be and has been controlled by either eliminating the source or adding after treatment to reduce the emissions. A major portion of pollution consists of fine particles, which also have a large and uncertain role in climate. In total, particles probably mask about one-third of long-term global warming, but possibly as much as half or very little. However, because a major source of the pollution and cause of mortality is fossil fuel combustion, as fossil carbon emissions are eliminated both the air pollution and climate harm will be curtailed. This connection presents an opportunity for creative solutions to both pressing problems.},

Coccidioides posadasii can be distinguished from C. immitis by numerous DNA polymorphisms, and we show how either of two microsatellite loci may be used as diagnostic markers for this species.

We model the importance of MSA-specific demand and supply characteristics through a set of interaction terms between these factors and monetary policy. The empirical analysis is cast in terms of a state-space approach with a stochastic trend component to absorb the impact of omitted variables. Robustness checks use panel data estimators with interaction terms. A lower federal funds rate is associated with home price run-ups in MSAs that are characterized by higher demand and tighter supply conditions.},

It has a higher protein content and a better balanced protein composition than do cereals, supplying high levels of lysine, histidine and methionine + cystine. Quinoa starch has much smaller granules than do cereal starches, has a lower amylose content and is more viscous. These differences should make it suitable for some specialised industrial uses, including manufacture of a carbohydrate-based cream substitute. The grain of most varieties also contains saponins, bitter compounds which have to be removed by washing or abrasion before consumption, but which are biologically active in several potentially valuable ways. Cultivation of quinoa in Europe will require the development of short, non-branched, early maturing varieties with large, white, low-saponin seeds. Quinoa is tolerant of drought and low soil fertility, and may be of value in Europe as a break between cereal crops and after potato crops. When grown in the areas to which it is best adapted, it should be able to compete with cereals in both human diets and animal rations.},

  abstract = {Background The relationship between sunlight hours, temperature, and suicide has been investigated in many previous studies, but with inconsistent findings. We conducted this meta-analysis aiming at providing clear evidence about whether sunlight hours and temperature can affect the risk of suicide. Methods Relevant literature published before 7 Jul 2018 was searched in three electronic database of PubMed, Web of science and Cochrane. Between-study heterogeneity in the effect estimates were examined by study design (i.e., exposure time resolution, temperature measure and suicide classification) and population vulnerability (i.e., sex, national income level, climate zone and study location). Results Regarding temperature-suicide association, we identified 14 studies that provided 23 effect estimates for meta-analysis. Our random-effects model showed that each 1\,°C increase in temperature was significantly associated with a 1\% increase in the incidence of suicide (Incidence Rate Radio (IRR)\,=\,1.01; 95\%CI\,=\,1.00–1.02; p\,{$<$}\,0.05). As for sunlight duration and suicide, 11 effect estimates from 4 studies were pooled using a fixed-effects model. Significant association between sunlight duration (per 1\,h increase) and the risk of suicide was not observed, and the pooled IRR was 1.00 (95\%CI\,=\,0.99–1.01; p\,{$>$}\,0.05). There was significant heterogeneity between previous studies' effect estimates, and significantly lower heterogeneity was noted for the female group, for studies that did analyses at daily scale, and for studies using mean temperature as the exposure indicator. Conclusion Our findings suggest a significant and positive association between temperature rises and incidence of suicide, and a non-significant association between sunlight duration and incidence of suicide. Populations living in tropical and temperate zones or at middle-income level may be particularly vulnerable to temperature increase.},

Combining panel data on illegal migrants with enforcement statistics, the effects of enforcement are found to be moderate: prices of border smugglers (‘coyotes’) increased by only 17\%, while the demand for smugglers has remained unchanged. Enforcement has however shifted illegal migrants to remote crossing places. Border crossing is now more time-intensive with higher prices for coyotes and risk of death. This geographic substitution raised migration costs by \$140, more than twice the effect of enforcement on smuggling prices.},

  abstract = {Geographic Information Science (GIScience) technology has been used to document, investigate, and predict patterns that may be of utility in both forensic academic research and applied practice. In examining spatial and temporal trends of the mass disaster that is occurring along the U.S.–Mexico border, other researchers have highlighted predictive patterns for search and recovery efforts as well as water station placement. The purpose of this paper is to use previously collected spatial data of migrant deaths from Arizona to address issues of data uncertainty and data accuracy that affect our understanding of this phenomenon, including local and federal policies that impact the U.S.–Mexico border. The main objective of our study was to explore how the locations of migrant deaths have varied over time. Our results confirm patterns such as a lack of relationship between Border Patrol apprehensions and migrant deaths, as well as highlight new patterns such as the increased positional accuracy of migrant deaths recorded closer to the border. This paper highlights the importance of using positionally accurate data to detect spatio-temporal trends in forensic investigations of mass disasters: without qualitative and quantitative information concerning the accuracy of the data collected, the reliability of the results obtained remains questionable. We conclude by providing a set of guidelines for standardizing the collection and documentation of migrant remains at the U.S.–Mexico border.},

  abstract = {Purpose Determine the differences between those attempting the suicide for the first time and those having the recurrent suicide attempts. Material \& method The consecutive 144 patients applied to the emergency department with the suicide attempt reason were prospectively evaluated. The patients attempting the suicide in previous years were grouped as the Recurrent Suicide Attempt (RSA) and patients attempting the suicide for the first time were grouped as the First Suicide Attempt (FSA), and their results were analyzed. Results 144 patients, whose ages were between 18 and 74 years old and age averages were 28.03\,±\,9.9/years, were included in our study. 67\% (n\,=\,97) of the patients was female and 32.6\% (n\,=\,47) of them was male, and the female/male rate was 2.06. It was determined that the recurrent suicide attempts were more risky as 8.45 fold (p\,=\,0.001, S.E\,=\,0.650, HR: 8.45 (1.361–30.219.9) in the smokers and 2.66 fold (S.E.\,=\,0.476, p\,=\,0.04, HR\,=\,2.66 (1.047–6.765) in the alcohol abusers with reference to the logistic regression analysis. Conclusion There are many risk factors depending on the individual and social environment in the RSA attempts. It was determined in our study that just the smoking and drinking alcohol increased the recurrent suicide attempt risk.},

The protein efficiency ratios (PER) of quinua, amaranth and lupin were also investigated. The results show that the native Andean tubers constitute sources of highly digestible carbohydrates, whereas the cereal-like grains are characterized by a protein content higher than that found in cereals, and an excellent protein quality. The Andean lupin possesses the advantage of an extremely high protein and energy density, although protein quality is low; this advantage, however, can be overcome by mixing with other traditional Andean food crops. It can be concluded that diets based on well-combined local food sources constitute an inexpensive, ecologically useful and physiologically adequate contribution to combat widespread malnutrition in the Andean area.}

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Late preterm births (LPTB, 34 0/7-36 6/7 weeks) account for a growing proportion of prematurity-associated short term morbidities, particularly respiratory, that require specialized care and prolonged neonatal hospital stays. OBJECTIVE: To assess short-term respiratory morbidity in LPTB compared to term births in a contemporary cohort of deliveries in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective collection of electronic data from 12 institutions (19 hospitals) across the United States on 233,844 deliveries between 2002 and 2008. Charts were abstracted for all neonates with respiratory compromise admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and LPTB were compared to term births in regard to resuscitation, respiratory support and respiratory diagnoses. A multivariate logistic regression analysis compared infants at each gestational week controlling for factors that influence respiratory outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), pneumonia, respiratory failure, standard and oscillatory ventilator support. RESULTS: Of 19,334 LPTB, 7,055 were admitted to a NICU and 2,032 had respiratory compromise. Of 165,993 term infants, 11,980 were admitted to a NICU, 1,874 with respiratory morbidity. Respiratory distress syndrome decreased from 10.5\% (390/3700) at 34 weeks to 0.3\% (140/41,764) at 38 weeks. Similarly, TTN decreased from 6.4\% (n=236) to 0.4\% (n=155), pneumonia from 1.5\% (n=55) to 0.1\% (n=62), and respiratory failure from 1.6\% (n=61) to 0.2\% (n=63). Standard and oscillatory ventilator support had similar patterns. Odds of RDS decreased with each advancing week until 38 weeks compared to 39-40 weeks (adjusted OR at 34 weeks 40.1 [95\% CI 32.0-50.3] and at 38 weeks 1.1 [95\% CI, 0.9-1.4]). At 37 weeks odds for RDS were greater than 39-40 weeks (3.1 [95\% CI, 2.5-3.7]), but the odds at 38 weeks did not differ from 39-40 weeks. Similar patterns were noted for TTN (adjusted OR at 34 weeks 14.7 [95\% CI, 11.7-18.4] and at 38 weeks 1.0 [95\% CI 0.8-1.2]); pneumonia (adjusted OR at 34 weeks 7.6 [95\% CI, 5.2-11.2] and at 38 weeks 0.9 [95\% CI, 0.6-1.2]), and respiratory failure (adjusted OR at 34 weeks 10.5 [95\% CI, 6.9-16.1] and at 38 weeks 1.4 [95\% CI, 1.0-1.9]). CONCLUSIONS: In a contemporary cohort, late preterm birth, compared with term delivery, was associated with increased risk for respiratory distress syndrome and other respiratory morbidity.}

  abstract = {Unequal exchange theory posits that economic growth in the “advanced economies” of the global North relies on a large net appropriation of resources and labour from the global South, extracted through price differentials in international trade. Past attempts to estimate the scale and value of this drain have faced a number of conceptual and empirical limitations, and have been unable to capture the upstream resources and labour embodied in traded goods. Here we use environmental input-output data and footprint analysis to quantify the physical scale of net appropriation from the South in terms of embodied resources and labour over the period 1990 to 2015. We then represent the value of appropriated resources in terms of prevailing market prices. Our results show that in 2015 the North net appropriated from the South 12 billion tons of embodied raw material equivalents, 822 million hectares of embodied land, 21 exajoules of embodied energy, and 188 million person-years of embodied labour, worth \$10.8 trillion in Northern prices – enough to end extreme poverty 70 times over. Over the whole period, drain from the South totalled \$242 trillion (constant 2010 USD). This drain represents a significant windfall for the global North, equivalent to a quarter of Northern GDP. For comparison, we also report drain in global average prices. Using this method, we find that the South’s losses due to unequal exchange outstrip their total aid receipts over the period by a factor of 30. Our analysis confirms that unequal exchange is a significant driver of global inequality, uneven development, and ecological breakdown.},

  abstract = {Groundwater forms the basis for millions of rural and urban livelihoods around the world. Building on insights from the theory of access, in this article we present how groundwater development has brought much well-fare in many parts of the world; and how resulting intensive groundwater use is leading to ill-fare through aquifer overexploitation and processes of water accumulation and dispossession. We show the difficulty of state regulation and the modest achievements of other governance approaches that aim to solve existing groundwater problems. To study these processes we propose a framework of analysis that is based on the study of hydrosocial-networks, the political economy of groundwater and the domains and discourses that define groundwater access. Such analysis highlights the challenges of devising policies and modes of governance that contribute to social and environmental sustainability in intensively used aquifers. These we argue should build on an analysis of equity that scrutinizes the discourses, actors, powers and procedures that define groundwater access. By inciting debates on equity a first and fundamental step can be made toward advancing more inclusive groundwater governance that crucially engages the marginalized and addresses their groundwater problems, concerns and needs.},

Although it is well established that housing is an important contextual determinant of migration flows, little attention has thus far been paid to the ways in which rising housing costs shape internal migration. In this paper, we use a time-series of annual intercounty migration in Germany for the period 2004–2017 to examine the association between increasing housing prices and changes in internal migration flows. For this, we apply fixed effects Poisson panel regression models to migration flow tables. Our results show that regions with rising housing costs experience declining inflows. In larger cities, rising housing costs are also associated with increasing outflows. Our study provides new insights into the relationship between house price dynamics and internal migration.},

We included studies testing the association between suicidal ideations and behaviours and economic poverty in low-income and middle-income countries using bivariate or multivariate analysis and published in English between January, 2004, and April, 2014. We identified 37 studies meeting these inclusion criteria. In 18 studies reporting the association between completed suicide and poverty, 31 associations were explored. The majority reported a positive association. Of the 20 studies reporting on the relationship between non-fatal suicidal ideations and behaviours and poverty, 36 associations were explored. Again, almost all studies reported a positive association. However, when considering each poverty dimension separately, we found substantial variations. These findings show a consistent trend at the individual level indicating that poverty, particularly in the form of worse economic status, diminished wealth, and unemployment is associated with suicidal ideations and behaviours. At the country level, there are insufficient data to draw clear conclusions. Available data show a potential benefit in addressing economic poverty within suicide prevention strategies, with particular attention to both chronic poverty and acute economic events.}

Using longitudinal data, parametric and nonparametric techniques, our main finding suggest that there is a substantial impact of childhood circumstances, captured by the school type, on the wage rate: attending private-voucher or private-paid schools systematically increases Chileans’ wages.},

In this study, drought awareness is defined and operationalized as the relative search interest activities within California, using the search term “drought” from Google Trends. First, the 2011–17 California drought is characterized in the duration–intensity curve with other historical California droughts for comparative purposes, using the 12-month standard precipitation index data (1895–2017). Second, the potential triggers of the peaks of drought awareness during the 2011–17 California drought are investigated through Google Trends and Google Search. The Google Trends data show that the first peak of drought awareness occurred when the drought condition reached its peak and the governor declared the drought emergency (January 2014). The other peaks in August 2014, April 2015, and January 2017 are related to public interest in drought recovery driven by the forecast of the strong El Niño winter of 2014/15, the governor’s issue of water use rules, and California floods in early 2017, respectively. Last, a power-law decay model of drought awareness is fitted to the Google Trends data. According to the fitted power-law model, Californians remained interested in drought after the social trigger–related peaks longer than they did after the natural trigger–related peaks. The findings of this study suggest that it is necessary to develop a more realistic social dynamic modeling for communities that can respond to natural and human triggers and capture interactions with awareness of related disasters.]}

  abstract = {With its hilly terrain and fast-paced growth, Nogales, Sonora, located on the US-Mexico border, is an extremely challenging place for sanitation and potable water provision wherein access to basic services is highly uneven. The labor demands of maquiladoras (typically, foreign-owned assembly plants) draw a steady influx of newcomers to the city, many of whom must turn to land “invasion” to create spaces for affordable housing. With tacit government approval, invasions occur on inexpensive, often topographically precarious land. Officials tend to frame these spaces as “illegal,” and, by extension, those who inhabit them, as existing outside the realm of formal governance. Despite such views, in this paper we understand the distinctions drawn between so-called formal and informal urban governance to unfold along two key axes: regularization of informal land titles and piped water and sanitation. We show how colonia residents feel caught in a state of suspended animation between hope for full urban service provision and trepidation that it will ever reach them. This ambiguity is visible in residents' and government officials' interactions with each other and the public services landscape, and in the unevenness of services provision. We critique the claim that such ambiguousness reflects an instrumental approach within official planning. Instead, we draw from state theory within political geography and political ecology to show how ‘the state’ is an emergent effect of the processes of inclusion and exclusion, an effect constantly destabilized by Nogales's precarious physical geography and uneven urban services grid. Reconceptualizing authority and ambiguity holds quite different implications for the struggle for urban services provision.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine (1) suicide trends by most prevalent methods in Queensland, Australia, during 2000–2015, and (2) characteristics of people by choice of suicide method in 2000–2013. Data were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register, which includes police and toxicology reports, post-mortem autopsy and Coroner's findings. Poisson and Joinpoint regression were used to study the first aim, and uni-variate and multi-variate logistic regression analyses were applied to investigate the second aim. Suicide method trends showed a significant increase in hanging for both sexes and poisoning with drugs for females, while there was a decline for poisoning by other means for both sexes, and ‘other methods’ decreased for males. Changes in the trends have altered the order of suicide methods, especially in males. Analyses of 8140 suicides were composed by the choice of method, distinguishable profiles by their demographic, clinical and social characteristics, such as having mental or physical illness or different recent life stressors were identified. This suggests that socio-cultural acceptability, and availability are the key drivers in the choice of suicide methods. Continuing increases in hanging is a big challenge in suicide prevention due to its lethality, easy realisation and its increasing acceptability.},

  abstract = {[The effects of the Great Recession on housing equity and homeownership have been well-documented. However, we know little about how rental households fared and the efficacy of housing subsidies in addressing affordability gaps. This paper examines the extent to which rental housing became less affordable for Extremely Low-Income (ELI) households – those earning less than 30\% of the Area Median Income (AMI). I then run regression models to determine the local characteristics most strongly associated with larger affordability gaps, with a focus on whether housing subsidies are effective at combating such gaps. Rental affordability gaps became more pronounced during the Great Recession. In nearly 70\% of the counties in my sample, there was an increase from 2007 to 2010 in the number of ELI households per affordable rental unit. Across the country, the increase was 17\%, a dramatic increase in only three years. There is considerable variation across the country, with acute affordability crises often concentrated in the South, particularly Florida. Regression models provide compelling evidence that housing vouchers, public housing, and project-based Section 8 subsidies play an important role in limiting the extent to which large numbers of ELI households are competing for a shortage of low-cost rental units. However, these programmes do not respond quickly to local needs – such as those brought about by the Great Recession. A pilot study where local housing authorities had funding to be more agile and responsive would be an important step toward crafting better policy. 关于经济大衰退对住房公平和住房拥有率的影响有充分记述。但是我们对租房居住家庭的生计情况以及住房补贴在解决支付能力差距方面的效果知之甚少。本文研究极低收入（ELI）家庭（这些家庭的收入低于地区中等收入（AMI）的30％）变得更难负担房屋租赁费用的情况。然后，我运用回归模型，确定了与较大支付能力差距密切相关的地方性特征，重点关注住房补贴是否能有效地消除这种差距。租金负担能力差距在经济大衰退时期变得更加明显。根据我研究的样本，2007年至2010年期间近70％的县极低收入家庭数量与低成本租赁房屋的比例都有所上升。全国范围内的增长率为17％，三年内增幅明显。全国各地存在相当大的差异，严重负担能力危机主要集中在南部地区，特别是佛罗里达州。回归模型提供了令人信服的证据，证明住房补助券、公共住房和基于项目的“第八节补贴”发挥了重要作用，缓解了大量极低收入家庭争夺短缺的低成本租赁房屋这一问题。但是，这些计划并没有针对当地需求做出快速反应，比如伴随大衰退产生的需求。目前需要一项试点研究，看看哪些地方住房部门资金充足，做出了更敏捷、更快速的反应，这将是朝着制定更为行之有效的政策迈出的重要一步。]}

Also it prepared a substantial change in the habits of consumption of the population, particularly the infantile one, which demonstrated in a notable increase in the consumption of delicacies.

This article analizes the relationship between health and economic growth and poverty. It finds that Mexico presents lower levels of health than those expected for its degree of development. It also concludes that there are huge contrasts among geographic zones, ethnic groups and socioeconomic status. This may be due to a somehow regressive public expenditure in health as half the population is not covered by any social security scheme. Hence it is needed a National Fund to finance healcare and allow a universal system that is independent of, for example, geographic zone or public/private source of work.},

  abstract = {The health of populations is related to features of society and its social and economic organization. This crucial fact provides the basis for effective policy-making for improving population health. While there is, understandably, much concern regarding the appropriate provision and financing of health services as well as ensuring that the nature of the services provided is based on the best evidence of effectiveness, health is a matter that goes beyond the provision of health services. Policies pursued by many branches of government and by the private sector, both nationally and locally, exert a powerful influence on health — and this book shows the direction in which we should be going. Just as decisions about health services should be based on the best evidence available, so should policies related to the social determinants of health. The social determinants covered by the book include the impact of early life; the life course, the social gradient, and health; labour market disadvantage, unemployment, non-employment, and job insecurity; the psychosocial environment at work; transport; social support and social cohesion; the politics of food; poverty, social exclusion, and minorities; social patterning of individual behaviours; social determinants of ethnic/ racial inequalities; social determinants of health in older age; neighbourhoods, housing, and health; sexual behaviour and sexual health; and social vulnerability.},

  abstract = {Ecological integrity is a term often used to describe the state of ecosystems subjected to anthropogenic pressures. It is usually defined closely to the literal definition of integrity: being whole or unimpaired. Considering the deep changes our world is undergoing, we argue here for ecological indicators that are not restricted to naturalness targets. We propose a conceptual framework for so-called level-2 indicators of ecological integrity, that evaluate how the integrity of ecosystems is preserved given their naturalness context. We develop reference relationships between indicator and contextual variables and then assess how an ecosystem is doing, compared to others in similar contexts, by its distance to this reference. We explore two such relationships: the amount of aboveground phytomass an ecosystem stores in a given volume (biomass packing efficiency) and the mean patch size given the total habitat amount in the landscape (habitat connectivity). Using datasets at the national and worldwide scale, we show that these indicators are objective measures of ecological integrity that allow the comparison of plant stands and landscapes across different environmental and naturalness contexts. This framework provides a basis to evaluate if the state of an ecosystem is degrading and paves the way to a triage system prioritizing conservation and restoration actions.},

We describe the direct and indirect influences of immigration policies on the health of individuals, families, and communities. The Arizona border region maintains close social, cultural, and linguistic ties to Mexico, and the amplified efforts to secure the border have been dramatic on the region and on the people who live there. The 261-mile stretch across the Arizona-Sonora Desert is the most deadly corridor for immigrants crossing into the United States because they are at risk of being killed, kidnapped, and coerced into smuggling drugs or dying in the desert. Gang-related violence is pushing more Central Americans, including unaccompanied minors, to the United States. The impact on individual migrants and their families has been devastating. We examine the health implications of policy and applaud the actions of the Arizona Nurses Association and the American Academy of Nursing to address the health needs of border communities.},

Routes with the least drug transportation costs and the lowest risk for drug confiscation and gang fight are most preferred. This study attempts to predict the ground trafficking corridors for transporting marijuana and opium derivatives from Mexico to the United States border. The cost surface, representing impedance to transport illicit drugs, is modeled by considering physical, socio-demographic, and drug violence factors. The impedance is then transferred to the road network to represent the cost for moving drugs along the roads, which becomes the main input for network analysis. The results from the routes simulation confirm largely the known territory divisions and the drug trafficking routes of the major Mexican drug organizations. The findings help us understand the development of drug trafficking routes in Mexico, which can potentially enhance our capability to predict the dynamics of drug smuggling routes.},

The outcome may be damaging especially for those on lower incomes because they cannot then live what we, as a society, regard as a reasonable life or indeed realize their economic potential.

  abstract = {Marx’s concept of metabolic rift has emerged as an important category in ecological Marxism, but has received relatively little attention in political ecology. This appears to reflect a combination of confusion regarding the conceptual basis of metabolic rift and theoretical antagonisms between its materialist dialectic and dominant post-humanist approaches in hybridist political ecology. In this essay, we argue that stronger engagement with metabolic-rift scholarship in political ecology could strengthen work in both areas. We briefly outline the possibilities for such engagement by first clarifying some of the conceptual confusion regarding the metabolic rift and its material-dialectical approach to human alienation and the socio-ecological contradictions and crises of capital accumulation and human development within capitalism. We then briefly discuss some of the key points of contention between this approach and dominant hybridist paradigms in political ecology. We conclude that, despite these conflicts, the concept of metabolic rift could provide essential critical contributions to political ecology's explanatory and emancipatory efforts.},

  abstract = {Resumen La etiología del tráfico de migrantes ha sido adscrita al crecimiento de la delincuencia organizada transnacional, la demanda de las redes sociales de los migrantes y de los empleadores. Los estudios sustentados en fuentes secundarias ligan el tráfico de migrantes a la expansión del crimen organizado transnacional, mientras que los sustentados en fuentes primarias lo describen como una actividad que no es operada por la delincuencia organizada. Este artículo, sustentado en fuentes primarias, subraya la preeminencia de los factores de atracción (la demanda de mano de obra migrante por parte de los empleadores estadunidenses), ya que después de entrevistar a 170 agentes facilitadores del cruce fronterizo (afcf) entre 2008 y 2015 (principalmente originarios del noreste de México), se encontró que en la mayoría de los casos (casi nueve de cada diez) los empleadores estadunidenses tenian un papel fundamental financiando o dando empleo a los migrantes indocumentados. The etiology of migrant smuggling has been ascribed to the growth of transnational organized crime, the demand of migrants’ social networks, and employer demand. Studies based on secondary sources tend to link this activity to transnational organized crime, while those based on primary sources argue that it is not organized-crime operated. This article, based on primary sources, underlines the preeminence of pull factors (the demand for migrant labor by U.S. employers), because, after interviewing 170 migrant smugglers between 2008 and 2015 (mainly from the Mexico’s Northeast), the author found that in almost nine out of ten cases, U.S. employers played a fundamental role in financing or hiring undocumented migrants.},

  abstract = {Background: There is a considerable variation in the prevalence of allergic disorders in developing countries. These differences may be attributable to different methodological problems and to the lack of operational definitions. Several studies suggest that the prevalence of allergic diseases has been increasing worldwide in recent years. However, in Mexico, there is no data in open population. Objective: To know in open population the prevalence of allergic diseases in the counties of Mexico City, the frequence of symptoms in each allergic disease, the therapeutic modalities that patients seek, the school and work annual absences and the amount of money that each patient spends in antiallergic drugs. Patients and methods: It was an open-population, cross-sectional trial, in two phases with a random sample size of 8,000 individuals from 214 public health centers. Statistical analysis was made with Excel 97-2004: Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and chi-square-test for discrete variables, p {$<$} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The prevalence of allergic diseases in Mexico City was 42.6\%, allergic rhinitis was the most frequent. Children are the largest age group affected. The highest prevalence was found in Tlahuac county. Coexistence of allergic diseases was found in 19.9\%. The 44.2\% of allergic patients attended to their general practitioner. 20.4\% of all patients spent 10-20\% of their income in medicines and 26\% do not have money to buy antiallergic drugs. School and work annual absences are 3.37 ± 3.86 and 6.2 ± 12.84 days, respectively. Conclusion: Allergic diseases must be considered a public-health problem in Mexico City.

  abstract = {To support a sustainable mobility transition and zero-carbon economy globally, important efforts are currently being made towards the use of sustainable transport, such as electric vehicles. In this context, the role of lithium is crucial for the manufacturing of electric vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries. However, more than half of the global lithium reserves are located in the three Latin American countries comprising the so-called Lithium Triangle – namely, Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. Each of these countries has a different national lithium regime and national policy to support the lithium industry in the processing and export of this natural resource. This paper analyses the potential of socio-technical transition theory for building a sustainable global lithium industry, with emphasis on Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. We adopt a multilevel perspective to explore the major mining policies and national lithium arrangements, industry challenges and future scenarios among major industry and public actors in these countries.},

For this purpose, 83 topsoil samples were collected and analyzed by ICP-MS. Results showed that the concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn are higher than background values, while Co, Cr and Ni concentrations are close to the background. Compared with heavy metal concentrations in selected cities around the world, As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations in urban soils of Isfahan are relatively enriched. Moreover, natural background concentrations of Co, Cr and Ni in Isfahan province soil are high and the apparent enrichment relative to other major cities of the world is due to this high background contents. Calculated contamination factor (CF) confirmed that As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn are extremely enriched in the urban soils. Furthermore, pollution load index (PLI) and Geoaccumulation index (Igeo) highlighted that highly contaminated cities are mostly affected by pollution from traffic, industries and Shahkuh Pb-Zn mine. Based on hazard quotients (HQ), hazard index (HI) and cancer risk (CR) calculated in this study, human health risk (particularly for Pb and Cd) have reached alarming scales. Results from principle component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) introduces three sources for soils heavy metals including mine and industries (mainly for Pb, Zn, Cd and As); urban activities (particularly for Cu, Pb and Zn); and geogenic source (Ni, Co and Cr).},

Independent risk factors for severe pulmonary disease included diabetes, recent history of cigarette smoking, income of {$<$} \$15,000 per year, and older age. Oral antifungal therapy before hospitalization was associated with a reduced risk of CM pneumonia. Risk factors for disseminated disease were black race, income of {$<$} \$15,000 per year, and pregnancy. Early treatment of CM with oral antifungal agents may prevent severe pulmonary disease in groups considered to be at high risk, such as elderly individuals, persons with diabetes, and smokers. Persons at risk for severe CM may benefit from vaccination once an effective CM vaccine is available.},

An industrial process for manufacturing infant food using quinoa as a basic raw material is being developed. The presence of antinutrients are of importance in this context, and this paper deals with saponins, phytic acid, tannins and protease inhibitors in quinoa seeds. The samples of quinoa analysed in this experiment contained two main types of saponins. The amount of saponin A (β-d-glucopyranosyl-[β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-α-l-arabino-pyranosyl-(1 → 3)]-3-β-23-dihydroxy-12-en-28-oate methyl ester) was 0·7\% of the dry weight and that of the saponin B (β-d-glucopyranosyl-[β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-α-l-arabino-pyranosyl-(1 → 3)]-3-β-23-dihydroxyolcan-12-en-28-oate was 0·2\% of the dry weight. These were the major saponins found in the quinoa bran collected while polishing the seeds. After scrubbing and washing, the level of saponin-A remaining in the seeds decreased to 0·31\% of the dry weight, and saponin-B was completely removed by this process. The content of phytic acid in the quinoa seeds was about 1\% of the dry matter, and scrubbing and washing reduced the phytic acid content of the seeds by about 30\%. Neither protease inhibitor nor tannins were detected in the quinoa seeds.}

  abstract = {Summary The transboundary nature of water dividing Mexico and the United States (U.S.) transforms the entire border region into an instrument of cooperation, a source of conflict, a national security issue, and an environmental concern. Reasonable data collection and research analysis have been conducted for surface waters by joint governmental institutions and non-governmental bodies. However, with the exception of the U.S. Transboundary Assessment Act Program (TAAP) (focusing on the Hueco Bolson, Mesilla Bolson, San Pedro and Santa Cruz aquifers), there is no comparable research, institutional development, or assessment of transboundary groundwater issues on the frontier. Moreover, data collection and methodologies vary between the two countries, there is no broadly accepted definition of the transboundary nature of an aquifer, and available legal and policy frameworks are constrained by non-hydrological considerations. Hence, there is a conceptual and institutional void regarding transboundary groundwater resources between Mexico and the U.S. The purpose of this paper is to bridge this void and characterize transboundary aquifers on the Mexico–US border. It reviews existing international frameworks for identifying hydrological and social criteria that characterize an aquifer as transboundary. It then assesses data from both countries to propose where and which aquifers could be considered transboundary. Finally, the paper proposes an agenda for assessing Mexico–US transboundary aquifers as a means for improving groundwater management in the border region.},

  abstract = {This article presents the results of a transboundary water quality monitoring program at the two Nogales area in the Arizona-Sonora border region. The program was carried out jointly in 1990 by U.S. and Mexican institutions. The results show pollution problems due to deficiencies in Nogales, Sonora municipal sewerage system, causing not only sewage spills in several parts of the city but also creating occasional transboundary problems. The results also showed potential illegal dumping of industrial hazardous waste (VOCs) into Nogales' municipal sewerage system. All of the organic compounds found in the sewage samples are solvents frequently used by the border industry. Occasional brakes of pipes spill the pollutants into the Nogales Wash, a water stream that runs parallel to Nogales' main sewerage line. Samples of the municipal water system showed no traces of pollutants. However, two rounds of samples detected concentrations of VOCs in wells used to supply water by trucks to low income neighborhoods in Nogales, Sonora. Ironically, the pollution detected in these wells has a greater impact in low income groups of the city that pay three to four times more per liter of water they consume, than the rest of the inhabitants with clean water from the municipal system.}

A phenomenological description stresses both the fact that there is no suicidal mental life without the experience of relief (rescue, remedy) in the option to kill oneself and that there is no experienced relief in this option without despair. This two-faced condition results in extreme tension and ambivalence, usually displayed in interpersonal relationships (i.e. calling for help through attempting suicide). It is furthermore necessary to acknowledge the possible cathartic effect of the knowledge of one’s option to suicide. This catharsis leads out of a life-endangering condition, but may need support nonetheless. For a fine-grained phenomenological understanding, it is required to take both sides of suicidal mental life into account.},

  abstract = {Strongly dominated by natural science disciplines (as civil and hydraulic engineering, irrigation studies, hydrology, climatology, and soil sciences), conventional thought characterizes water control technology as morally and politically ‘impartial’ – a tool to be used, a means to a desired end. In this paper we challenge this view by showing how technological artefacts are scripted or coded by human agency, social norms on right and wrong, and power relationships, and how they, in turn, ‘structure’ or ‘mediate’ the moral actions and decisions of human beings. We discuss at length what technology is, how its designs are inherently social, and how the social coordination of labour as well as technology’s replicability are central for it to emerge and exist. Through a case study about tank irrigation in India, we demonstrate how the moral agency of maintaining a certain social order in the tank-irrigated area was delegated to technological designs of sluices, waste weirs, and other discharge structures, but also to the layout of canals, and the landscape of the command area. Precisely this delegation of the reproduction of social order to material structures allowed the sustaining of differentiated power relations over a long period of time. In conclusion, we claim that our argument has much larger relevance for the politics of water control technology, even for mega-technology such as large dams. We claim that engineers and planners not only shape material designs of water control structures but that they implicitly ’materialize morality’. In that sense, re-organizing water rights and re-distributing water resources is not merely a matter of redressing institutional policy frameworks but equally involves re-moralizing and re-politicizing the very material technological artefacts.},

  abstract = {Summary Episodic streamflow events in the Upper Santa Cruz River recharge a shallow alluvial aquifer that is an essential water resource for the surrounding communities. The complex natural variability of the rainfall-driven streamflow events introduces a water resources management challenge for the region. In this study, we assessed the impact of projected climate change on regional water resources management. We analyzed climate change projections of precipitation for the Upper Santa Cruz River from eight dynamically downscaled Global Circulation Models (GCMs). Our analysis indicates an increase (decrease) in the frequency of occurrence of dry (wet) summers. The winter rainfall projections indicate an increased frequency of both dry and wet winter seasons, which implies lower chance for medium-precipitation winters. The climate analysis results were also compared with resampled coarse GCMs and bias adjusted and statistically downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections readily available for the contiguous U.S. The impact of the projected climatic change was assessed through a water resources management case study. The hydrologic framework utilized includes a rainfall generator of likely scenarios and a series of hydrologic models that estimate the groundwater recharge and the change in groundwater storage. We conclude that climatic change projections increase the uncertainty and further exacerbate the already complicated water resources management task. The ability to attain an annual water supply goal, the accrued annual water deficit and the potential for replenishment of the aquifer depend considerably on the selected management regime.},

In this assessment, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and particulate matter (PM) species were used from four sites, two on either side of the border. An examination of median levels and principal component analysis indicated the dominance of soil dusts and mobile sources. Pairwise comparisons of sites for VOCs associated with mobile sources revealed statistically significant differences between sites in the central Nogales area vs. the two sites furthest from the border. Particulate lead at Mexican sites was higher and significantly different vs. US sites. Although further analyses are necessary, findings suggest that local and immediate mobile/other anthropogenic and soil dust influences are present throughout Nogales, with particulate lead from leaded motor vehicle exhaust or soldering operations being a possible influence on the Mexican side.},

Aim To investigate the impacts of suicide-related or mental health consultation-related internet use.  Methods We conducted prospective observational longitudinal study with data collection at baseline screening (T0), 1 week after T0 (T1) and 7 weeks after T0 (T2). Participants with a stratified random sampling from 744,806 internet users were 20–49 years of age who employed the internet for suicide-related or mental health consultation-related reasons and internet users who did not. The main outcome was suicidal ideation. Secondary outcome measures comprised hopelessness, depression/anxiety, and loneliness.  Results The internet users who had employed the internet for suicide-related or mental health consultation-related reasons at T0 (n = 2813), compared with those who had not (n = 2682), showed a significant increase in suicidal ideation (β = 0.38, 95\%CI: 0.20–0.55) and depression/anxiety (β = 0.37, 95\%CI: 0.12–0.61) from T1 to T2. Those who disclosed their own suicidal ideation and browsed for information about suicide methods on the web showed increased suicidal ideation (β = 0.55, 95\%CI: 0.23–0.88; β = 0.45, 95\% CI: 0.26–0.63, respectively). Although mental health consultation with an anonymous other online did not increase suicidal ideation, increased depression/anxiety was observed (β = 0.34, 95\%CI: −0.03–0.71).  Conclusions An increased suicidal ideation was observed in the young and middle-aged who employed the internet for suicide-related or mental health consultation-related reasons. Mental health consultation via the internet was not useful, but those who did so showed worsened depression/anxiety.}

Recent work suggests that, during the intrauterine period a disturbance in nutrition of the lung resulting from fetal pulmonary vascular constriction results in alveolar-cell damage and a decrease in pulmonary surface activity with resultant atelectasis. Data on respiratory work levels, oxygen consumption and arterial oxygen tension suggest that there is an oxygen debt in the acute stage of the disease. Such data have further clarified the pathogenesis of the metabolic and respiratory components of the acidosis and the secondary effects thereof. In prevention, prophylaxis of prematurity is of major importance. A program of treatment designed to combat the various aspects of the pathophysiological disturbances is described in the form of a case profile. Modern methods of observation, biochemical control and treatment, as well as the necessity for critical evaluation, suggest that infants with RDS are best cared for in special centres. IMAGES:}

  abstract = {Even though the Chilean economy has experienced a sustained economic growth and made enormous progress in reducing poverty in the last 25years, its income inequality continues to be among the highest in the world. Given its importance, the literature has paid considerable attention to income inequality in Chile. Nevertheless, all of the existing studies use a cross-section distribution of earnings when analyzing inequality. Cross-section and lifetime measures of inequality are different. While the latter reflects long run resources available to individuals, the former does not. This emphasizes the dynamic dimension of inequality. This paper focuses on the analysis of income inequality from a lifetime perspective for the Chilean economy using a search-theoretic framework. The model, which is structurally estimated with Chilean data, captures the dynamic of the labor market of male workers actively participating in the market and is used to simulate careers to construct lifetime measures of inequality. The results indicate that inequality is not only high in a cross-section perspective, but also in a lifetime perspective; and that low mobility is the main source of lifetime inequality in the Chilean labor market. Hence, regulation of the labor market matters because it affects the degree of mobility in the market.},

It is also cultivated in other continents, in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Quinoa production is around 80 000 t (8 × 107 kg) annually. Quinoa is a unique food grain, which contains all essential amino acids in the correct balance. It has the ability to adapt to a wide range of agroecological regions. The tender leaves of quinoa are also edible. Quinoa could contribute to food security and nutrition for humankind worldwide. The year 2013 was designated as ‘The International Year of the Quinoa’ by the FAO. Several events were promoted worldwide.},

  abstract = {Suicidal behavior is a major problem worldwide and at the same time has received relatively little empirical attention. This relative lack of empirical attention may be due in part to a relative absence of theory development regarding suicidal behavior. The current paper presents the Interpersonal Theory of Suicidal Behavior. We propose that the most dangerous form of suicidal desire is caused by the simultaneous presence of two interpersonal constructs—thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness (and hopelessness about these states)—and further, that the capability to engage in suicidal behavior is separate from the desire to engage in suicidal behavior. According to the theory, the capability for suicidal behavior emerges, via habituation and opponent processes, in response to repeated exposure to physically painful and/or fear-inducing experiences. In the current paper, the theory’s hypotheses are more precisely delineated than in previous presentations (Joiner, 2005), with the aim of inviting scientific inquiry and potential falsification of the theory’s hypotheses.}

While conflict over education was the main stimulus for the move, this paper argues that the migration also offered an opportunity to restore the system of land tenure Mennonites had practiced in Imperial Russia. Conservative Mennonites had reified a tsarist-imposed system of semi-communal land tenure, making it a requirement of faithful religious and social practice. These sensibilities were, however, incompatible with the land tenure system of the new Dominion of Canada giving rise to tension and conflict. When migration became a reality, conservative Mennonites sought to reestablish the colony and village tenure systemby seeking a block sale of their individual lands in Manitoba and by purchasing land in Mexico under colony title, thereby restoring semi-communal land tenure.}

Vasculitic complications were unanticipated and often abrupt in onset, and delayed therapeutic intervention was characteristic. The diagnosis of vasculitis/encephalitis due to Coccidioides immitis infection must be based on clinical judgment, since serum antibody titers, cerebrospinal fluid findings, and initial radiological studies are not always helpful. Institution of both intravenous and intracisternal administration of amphotericin B and possibly concomitant intravenous administration of dexamethasone may be warranted in situations in which the association of C. immitis with CNS vasculitis or encephalitis appears likely before serologic or cultural confirmation of C. immitis infection involving the CNS is available.}

Less well remembered are the actions the administration took against the peasantry, when federal troops stationed in southwestern Chihuahua killed several Mexicans while protecting a colony of Canadian-born Mennonite fanners. This quiet display of the central government’s authority was not the first of its kind in the area around the growing town of Cuauhtémoc. President Alvaro Obregón’s administration had also sent troops to Cuauhtémoc, and their mission then as under Cárdenas was the protection of the lives and properties of the small Mennonite enclave that resided in the area south of Chihuahua City. It was Obregón who invited the religious minority to settle in Mexico shortly after his election, and it was he who pledged federal government protection of the Mennonites’ interests. The incongruities evident in the case begin therefore not with the stationing of the troops in Cuauhtémoc, but much earlier, with the very concessions that Obregón gave the Mennonites in the years after the Mexican Revolution.}
