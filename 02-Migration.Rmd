In this chapter, we explore the interplay among: geographic mobility of the population, income, and race, with a specific emphasis on analyzing out-of-state mobility for current residence at Metropolitan areas as the primary geographic unit of analysis. Drawing on economic theory, our study delves into the intricate dynamics that shape the patterns of population movement, shedding light on the factors influencing individuals' decisions to relocate across state lines. By examining the nexus of geographic mobility, income differentials, and racial composition, we aim to deepen our understanding of the complex interrelationships within metropolitan contexts and their implications for regional economic development with a focus on the Hispanic population. 

We initially consider housing demand in relation to income. According to the basic principles of human capital theory, lay out during the last century by pioneer scholars such as: Ted Schultz, Jacob Mincer, Milton Friedman, Sherwin Rosen and of course, Gary Becker in his classic book:  Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis with Special Reference to Education [@beckerInvestmentHumanCapital1962],[@NBERbeck94-1]  income is determined among other factors, by education attainment levels  both formal as represented by a particular schooling level or a specific job training, age, which captures experience and skills acquired overtime [@stiglitzAlternativeTheoriesInequality2022] and several personal characteristics that may include gender[@reardonIncomeInequalityIncome2011] and race [@goetzRaciallyConcentratedAreas2019], a particular important factor in the context of a diverse country like the US. Together this factors impact productivity determining earning potential and actual income levels across occupations [@dumenilChangingPatternsIncome2022] and industries. 

Empirical evidence suggest that less educated households are less likely to be homeowners, [@choiHeterogeneousEffectsInteractions2022], furthermore,  education inequality could be a factor contributing to an increasing lack of housing affordability in Metropolitan areas associated with particular highly skilled labor markets. 

Data on US population growth, shows that cities with more educated residents have grown faster than comparable cities with less human capital[@glaeser2004rise]. This environment, in turn creates a cycle where some areas of the country are more attractive to specific population groups[@berryDivergenceHumanCapital2005],[@choiWageTrickleRent2021] and at the same time generate incentives to migrate for particular demographic segments as they are being priced-out of the housing market. 



## Data and Methods

In this chapter the main source of information analyzed is the American Community Survey (ACS) 5 year estimates for the period 2017-2021. This official data set is the premier source for detailed population and housing information in th US. Is collected by the US Census Bureau and is publicly available for a wide set of geographical scales including Metropolita Statistical areas (MSAs).   

Although other temporal report formats are available for the ACS, this investigation chose the 5 year estimates for the most up to date release available at the moment of conducting this research given its wide geographic coverage which allows to detect detailed spatial patterns and is representative of the US population characteristics.  

## Moving across state borders.  

How real state market dynamics and home prices in particular are driving the geographic mobility of the US population across state boundaries.  To analyze this issue we focus in the out of state population movement within US (MSAs).

Figure 1, showns which Metropolitan areas have been attracting the most out of state population in the period 2017-2021.

According to ACS 2017-2021. 5 year estimates. New York-Newark-Jersey City, Washington-Arlington-Alexandria and Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, AZ Metro Area received the greatest flows of inter state migration in this period. 

Although Border MSA  are not particularly important destinations for in migration considering the total population,  San Diego-Chula Vista Carlsbad is the only MSA that is part of the top 20 MSA by its magnitude of inflows in the country. Some other MSA located in Border states but not in border adjacent areas with Mexico that form part of the top 20 list are the following:  Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX Metro Area rank 5, 
Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA Metro Area 8th place and Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX Metro Area, 12th position.

This base scenario considers the total population, However, by incorporating population race as a control variable, we gain insights into the geographical preferences of different racial groups, including Hispanics, Blacks, Whites, and Asians. This enables us to determine whether certain cities with higher living costs exhibit a greater attraction for specific population segments. Additionally, we can identify the areas that are comparatively less appealing to each racial group. This analysis provides valuable information regarding the underlying factors that influence migration patterns and population dynamics.

******Here explain!!!!

Before turning our attention to the interplay between race and geographic mobility we take on the association between income, Metropolitan area size as measure by its population and personal income. 

## Housing demand determinants: population growth, income and home prices

Basic economic theory suggest that housing demand is influenced by specific demographic factors. Population growth is a paramount factor, in particular the interaction between population outflows and those incoming that define net migration shape housing demand  which in turn, given the scarcity principle that ultimately rules all human endeavor,  ensures an upward signal to the pricing system. 

Although net migration flows allow to distinguish more subtle attraction elements that each geographic area is featuring, it is the population movement that manifest to balance supply and demand. But why population moves?  Centrally another economic variable plays a key role to understand incentives to relocate or the basic decision to acquire a home. That is income, per capita income, which is directly related to labor market dynamics in a given moment in time. 

Despite that home values by themselves act as signals to achieve  demand and supply equilibrium, this important factor can be particularly volatile when considering the real state market environment, given that forces such as expectations play a pivotal role, home prices fluctuations can be particularly susceptible to the wider macroeconomic policy decisions. 

The following figure considers data on the factors discussed above, for all Metropolitan statistical areas located at the US Mexico border States. The aim of the analysis is to capture the relationship among this important factors and distinguish patterns within the Us-Mexico border region.

Although data provides sound evidence that personal per capita income and house prices are positively correlated, degrees of correlation varies between border state¬¥s metropolitan areas, with the strongest relationship being observed by Californian MSA, where we also find the most expensive metropolitan areas of the border states considering housing prices. 

In addition, there is only a weak positive relationship between house prices as measured by the HPI and population size, this is the case for New Mexico, where relative large size metropolitan areas such as Albuquerque still exhibit affordable house prices. Population size being a proxy for housing demand. 

While this pattern found makes sense considering the basic principles of economics concerning scarcity, it also suggest that other factors influence house price fluctuations, including the underlying labor market structure and demand for highly skilled labor force, which is certainly the case for metropolitan areas located near the Silicon valley region in California such as the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara msa, which is the most expensive metropolitan area in the whole country considering the house price index for 2022, but is not necessarily a big size metropolitan area.


Secondly, using a Cartesian approach to analyze resulting patterns from the above data representation, and dividing the  plot into four quadrants:  starting with the top right section being quadrant one, where the combination of higher than average house prices and  higher than average income levels are found and moving counter clock wise towards quadrant four, formed by the combination of higher than average house prices  together with lower than average personal income levels; we found that within the subset of msa that are located along the US-Mexico border, 95% lay inside the third quadrant, where there is a combination of below average personal income with relatively inexpensive house prices, Whereas only one  msa in this particular geographic region, which is San Diego-Chula vista-Carlsbad, is situated at the first quadrant.

 
This feature denotes a very different set of economic dynamics for the local movement of people across the border making San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad a very prone area for out  migration, including cross border migration given the real state price differentials combined with the economic integration that bi national trade and manufacture hubs have developed in the Tijuana metropolitan area.  

Furthermore,  considering the information for  year 2020, there is evidence of sharp differences among border metropolitan areas ^[defined for the purposes of this investigation as urban areas that lay  along the border line] house prices and we find for example that El Paso, TX, the second largest border metropolitan area  along the US-Mexico border, has a HPI 70% lower than  San Diego¬¥s, CA.  the city across Tijuana.  These patterns provide evidence of the relevance to study the housing markets in specific locations along the US- Mexico border, Tijuana-San Diego being an emblematic case study.

#^ indicates the start of a string. It ensures that the match starts from the beginning of the string.
#[^,] is a negated character class that matches any character except a comma (,). The ^ inside the character class negates the class, so [^,] matches any character that is not a comma.
# + means that the previous pattern (in this case, [^,]) should match one or more times. It allows the regular expression to match multiple non-comma characters in sequence.

# \\b is a word boundary anchor. It matches the position between a word character and a non-word character. In this case, it ensures that the state code is not part of a longer word.

# [A-Z]{2} is a character class that matches any uppercase letter (A to Z). The {2} quantifier specifies that exactly two uppercase letters should be matched consecutively.

# \\b is another word boundary anchor that ensures the state code is not part of a longer word.

### Here we ca see this raw rate bias, it favors structural demographic trends for example captures the effect of population moving to military bases and   colleges towns. 
  
## For Hispanics the highest raw rates are:   Jacksonville, NC, Hinesville, GA, Las Cruces, NM, Yuma,AZ, East Stroudsburg, PA
# The first is a large military base. and the second too with Fort Stewart, the largest U.S. Army installation by area in the eastern United States.
  
  # The bottom or places that are not destinations for hispanics are: 
#Wheeling, WV, Sheboygan,WI, Gadsden, AL,  Lewiston-Auburn,ME, Pine Bluff,AR
  
# Blacks

# The highest rate are in Hinesville, GA  (Military base related migration),  Killeen-Temple, TX, which is known as a military "boom town
  
# Asians alone no hispanic

## Interesante Aqui podemos conjuntar la idea de racial differentiation. the question here is what are the places towards which, the white population is not  migrating.   The bottom 5 are:  Mexican border towns: Laredo, Brownsville, Madera CA, Vineland-Bridgeton, NJ. (A black town) McAllen-Edinburg-Mission and
