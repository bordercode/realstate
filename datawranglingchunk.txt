## The bigger the size of the population flowing out From a particular MSA, the lower the HPI gap. That is, bigger negative net migration movements took place between MSAs with smaller HPI gaps or more similar housing markets. In addition this negative relationship  is not significan for  movers tbetween a low cost area and high cost MSA (negative Hpi gaps between orign and destination)  which indicates  that not necesarily big netfows take place to more expensive areas.
