<p>From an economic perspective, house prices represent a main component of inflation, overall price level trends are currently a priority for economic policy in general and particularly relevant when studying residential mobility.</p>
<p>Empirical evidence reported by current academic research <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.2412" role="doc-biblioref">Stawarz, Sander, and Sulak 2021</a>)</span> as well as market experts <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-s&amp;p/case-shillerEconomicData2023" role="doc-biblioref">S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 2023</a>)</span>, indicate that, beyond labor market incentives, housing affordability represent a key factor when considering the selection of a place to reside <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-FUSS201635" role="doc-biblioref">Füss and Zietz 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In fact, real state markets may play a critical role for important social processes such as migration, both internal (within the same country)<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this investigation, internal migration is defined as the change in residence location from one particular Metropolitan area to another&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> or international.</p>
<p>In this chapter, exploratory data analysis is conducted on house property values, focusing on metropolitan areas as the geographic scale across the US.</p>
<p>Metropolitan areas are geographic units that are particularly suited to understand regional real state dynamics and provide a base scenario to study internal migration patterns within the US territory as well as specific regions such as the US-Mexico border.</p>
<div id="data-and-methods." class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Data and methods.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-and-methods."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The study strategy follows a spatial and temporal design, it is argued that analyzing housing costs evolution in a geographic context may reveal patterns that help to better understand residential mobility and deliver valuable insights about internal migration flows and the underlying regional economic incentives.</p>
<p>The primary spatial unit of analysis for this study is the Metropolitan Statistical area (MSAs). MSAs are geographical regions defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that consist of one or more counties that contain a core city of 50,000 or more inhabitants, and surrounding areas with significant social and economic ties <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-ofr1990federalregister" role="doc-biblioref">Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration 1990</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>It is argued that Metropolitan statistical areas provide an appropriate level of detail, improving over the aggregate perspective that states offer or the traditional county boundaries scale, which lack the economic synergies and the broad social component that MSAs achieve by considering the interaction between a core and a set of adjacent communities. For this theoretical considerations MSAs were selected over other alternative geographical scales for this particular analysis.</p>
<p>The study covers all 48 continental adjacent US states, excluding: District of Columbia, Alaska and non continental territories Hawaii and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>A primary goal is to explore real state market fluctuations over time, to achieve this purpose we measure three concepts: house price levels, price appreciation and purchasing parity based on housing prices.</p>
<p>To measure house price levels the main input variable is the quarterly seasonally adjusted house price index for the period 1995:Q1 (base year) to 2022:Q4 for 387 MSAs for which Federal housing finance agency (FHFA) price indices are available.</p>
<p>The FHFA House Price Index (FHFA HPI) is a broad economic measure of the movement of single family house prices in the United States <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-fhfaHousePriceIndex2022" role="doc-biblioref">FHFA 2022</a>)</span>. The data set analyzed in this chapter contains purchase only transactions, the aim is to capture the price level fluctuations a feature estimated by using sales price data as opposed to appreciation. (which considers a repeat transaction methodology).</p>
<p>To measure the underlying rate of appreciation of a given house price, the Freddie Mac House price index (FMHPI), is incorporated. This is a repeat transaction index, which compares the price of the same property over two or more transactions and is explicitly designed to capture appreciation while holding constant basic factors such as physical location, climate, housing type, etc.,between transactions. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-freddiemacFreddieMacHouse2023" role="doc-biblioref">Freddie Mac 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>By construction, therefore, the repeat transaction requirement exclude new homes.</p>
<p>Whereas HPI in data sets such as FHFA, measures current price level not considering transactions over the same property.</p>
<p>To complement the perspective obtained by the Federal housing finance agency HPI data and the Freddie Mac HPI, the housing component of the regional price parities (RPPs) indicator for year 2022 (the latest release as the time of writing this investigation) is included.</p>
<p>This is an official indicator reported by the Bureau of economic analysis (BEA) which measure the differences in price levels across states and metropolitan areas for a given year and are expressed as a percentage of the overall national price level <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bureauofeconomicanalysisRegionalPriceParities2023" role="doc-biblioref">Bureau of Economic Analysis 2023b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This indicator is particularly informative of the population purchasing power, specially it allows price comparisons relative to the national average.</p>
<p>To capture demand side factors, Official population estimates from the US Census Bureau were obtained for years 2010-2020 <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-uscensusbureauPopulationEstimatesEstimated2023" role="doc-biblioref">US Census Bureau 2023</a>)</span>, this is a variable that captures demographic dynamics overtime and serve as a proxy for housing demand.</p>
<p>Per capita personal Income (PPI) by metropolitan area from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis is also included.
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bureauofeconomicanalysisPersonalIncomeCounty2023" role="doc-biblioref">Bureau of Economic Analysis 2023a</a>)</span>. This variable contributes to capture inequality and financial barriers to access the housing market. In addition the income to house price ratio is useful to inform on the contextual factors affecting the decisions to move.</p>
<p>A second goal of this chapter is to reveal the impact of monetary policy shifts on housing demand by examining time series data for interest rates. Specifically, we analyze how changes in interest rates influence the demand for home loans, which, in turn, has a significant effect on home prices.</p>
<p>Interest rates serve as a crucial macroeconomic indicator that directly affects the demand for housing. By exploring the dynamics of interest rates over time, we aim to shed light on the influential role they play in shaping housing market trends in the presence of external economic shocks, particularly important during the study period we document: a) the effect of the so called “Great Recession” related to the sub-prime mortgage market collapse in 2009 and b) the global health emergency declaration of early 2020.</p>
<p>A third goal is to analyze non-conventional economic data<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Conventional economic data is defined for the purposes of this investigation as repositories generated by the Census Bureau, Bureau of economic analysis and federal agencies and institutions that provide estimates, projections and indicators related to the housing market&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a>, to understand the population sentiment towards the housing market, we propose the use of the Google trends tool.</p>
<p>This tool provides insights into the relative popularity of search terms over a particular period of time and across different regions. And it has become a relevant source for academic research recently from areas in the social sciences field as well as other disciplines such as natural sciences and public health. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-askitasTrendSpottingHousingMarket2016" role="doc-biblioref">Askitas 2016</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-avramescuNowcastingRomanianMigration2021" role="doc-biblioref">Avramescu and Wiśniowski 2021</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-vazquezGRANDESDATOSGOOGLE2020" role="doc-biblioref">Vázquez and López-Araiza B. 2020</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-kamMonitoringDroughtAwareness2019" role="doc-biblioref">Kam, Stowers, and Kim 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>By analyzing the search volume data obtained from Google Trends, this data source allows us to observe and compare the changes in interest and search patterns for various topics using a score in the close domain [0-100], where 100 indicates the highest volume of searches for a particular place and time and 0 indicates the lowest volume for the term at a precise moment in time and location.</p>
<p>By analyzing the search behavior of internet users, Google Trends offers a valuable resource for understanding the relative level of interest and attention that a topic or keyword generates within the online population. We analyze three important words that characterize equal number of aspects for the US housing markets: affordable home, Foreclosure and eviction.
This keywords allow to answer questions on where and when does people (Google users) are looking for this words, specially the term Foreclosure, serve as a proxy for home owners interest whereas eviction represents the renter´s segment.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Results.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#results."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The analysis is organized in two stages: the first provides a national approach to the housing prices fluctuations for state and MSA scales. While the second focuses on the US Mexico border region.</p>
<p>When we analyze real estate market fluctuations in the context of affordability housing, understanding regional inflation patterns is crucial. In particular in this section the analysis starts by exploring the housing component for the regional price parity (RPP), this is an indicator developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to measure price fluctuations at a regional scale.</p>
<p>By xamining this aggregate economic indicator it is possible to distinguish which states of the country exhibit the most expensive housing markets and therefore which areas of the country represent particular challenges either for households entering the market or those families already paying a mortgage.</p>
<p>Regional price parties capture variations in the cost of living across different region of the country, this indicator is important because it helps to understand the relative purchasing power and living standards in different geographic areas and particularly when considering the housing component, it provides a measure to compare the real estate market conditions relative to the country.</p>
<p>The RPP base level is the national average which takes a value of 100, so RPP values above this national threshold indicate relative more expensive states in terms of housing prices.</p>

<p>It can be seen that the US west coast border state of California has the highest housing price parity among the 48 states (excluding Hawaii, Alaska and DC) for 2021. This pattern suggest financial pressures for residents in west coast states that may influence the current out of state internal migration documented by academic research elsewhere <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-blumenbergJobsHousingBalance2021" role="doc-biblioref">Blumenberg and King 2021</a>)</span> for states such as California.</p>
<p>In order to get a higher level of detail on the behavior of house price fluctuations, metropolitan statistical areas around the country are now analyzed, considering the House price index developed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, <a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;indicated as FHFA for further reference in this work&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a>, this measure is explicitly designed to capture fluctuations of the housing market since it includes prices of new homes as discussed in the methodology section of this chapter.</p>
<p>The data analysis strategy design aims to extract the changes in prices over a two decade time frame for each metropolitan area so, we are able to measure not only which metropolitan areas have registered the bigger price gains between 2000 and 2020 but also it´s annual rate of growth.</p>
<p>Measuring price fluctuations using the HPI developed by an independent federal agency such as FHFA, is important for two reasons in the context of this investigation: I) It informs on the potential changes on home equity fluctuations over time with a geographic perspective, which expose real estate investment opportunities II) It reflects existing financial barriers and/or opportunities to entry into the housing market for households looking to relocate, so is an appropriate economic indicator that helps to explain current internal migration patterns.</p>
<p>Figure 2 below shows the House Price index (HPI) distribution across the 387 U.S. Metropolitan statistical areas as of 2020. Each circle represents a HPI measure with its size corresponding to the HPI value.</p>
<p>The index depicts housing market prices taking 1995 as base year. So higher values indicate a relative average increase overtime and therefore more expensive locations than those with smaller circles.</p>

<p>Empirical findings reveal a pronounced surge in housing prices, as gauged by the House Price Index (HPI), within geographically delineated metropolitan areas across the United States. Noteworthy regions exhibiting such trends encompass metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) situated along the West Coast, the southeastern part of Florida, and the northwestern region. Over the span of the past three decades, these identified regions have witnessed substantial increase in housing values.</p>
<p>Among the states located on the West Coast, the State of California is particularly outstanding with areas of concern such as the Bay area where the so called Silicon Valley region represents a mayor labor market hub particularly for highly skilled workers associated with the technology sector. This geographic area holds substantial economic importance due to its concentration of technological innovation, fostering an environment that attracts and sustains a skilled workforce with above average income which also translates into relevant tax revenue sources for the entire state.</p>
<p>Furthermore within California, and right at the US southern border, the San Diego MSA, ranks among the top 10 most expensive metropolitan areas of the entire state with a relative house price increase of 363.6 per cent in the last 25 years.</p>
<p>Using the above estimated pattern it is convenient to determine <strong>which metropolitan areas registered the highest price increments since base year 1995</strong> according to the Federal House Finance HPI?</p>
<p>Figure 3 illustrates the ranking of the nation’s 20 foremost metropolitan areas based on their respective positions in the House Price Index (HPI) for the year 2020. It is important to note that these areas signify the highest relative increases in home prices compared to the base year of 1995, rather than indicating the absolute highest-priced urban population centers.</p>

<p>We now examine four discernible patterns that emerge when analyzing the top 20 metropolitan areas with the highest appreciation rates as measured by the annual growth on the HPI during the last 27 years:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
<li><p>The importance of the US Mexico border region. <span class="math inline">\(40\%\)</span> of the top 20 (MSAs) with the highest appreciation rates are located at border states with Mexico.</p></li>
<li><p>Within the US Mexico border, the importance of California state is clear, representing <span class="math inline">\(75\%\)</span> of the border MSA with highest HPI growth. In fact San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad exhibits the highest annual increase in 2022 with a <span class="math inline">\(18.55\%\)</span><br></p></li>
<li><p>The real state market in Florida shows the fastest growing level of prices with sharp increases particularly during the Trump administration, with Metropolitan areas such as West Palm Beach, North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Naples Marco Island and Tampa featuring double digit increases with a maximum increase of <span class="math inline">\(32.77\%\)</span> the highest HPI annual growth in the nation.</p></li>
<li><p>Traditional non high HPI areas in border states such as Texas are now starting to gain dynamism, the clear example in this region is the Austin-Roundrock-Georgetown Metropolitan area, where external economic factors such as the recent establishment of companies to support the electric vehicle industry have contribute to create speculative pressures on local real estate markets.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Tesla announced its decision to build a Gigafactory in Austin, which currently manufactures electric vehicles and attracts thousands of employment opportunities. Suppliers, service providers, and other companies in the electric vehicle industry have begun to establish operations near the Gigafactory, creating additional job opportunities and further contributing to housing demand. The presence of a major company like Tesla often attracts real estate investors looking to capitalize on the economic growth and potential appreciation in property values. Increased investor interest can lead to higher demand for housing, further impacting the housing market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Although the above spatial patterns offer detailed empirical evidence to understand the incentives for population movements between metropolitan areas within states, one question that arises in the context of economic determinants of house prices is: What role does available economic policy instruments have played to shape the US real state markets in the last two decades?</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Interest rates as a key macroeconomic policy instrument shaping real estate decisions.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interest-rates-as-a-key-macroeconomic-policy-instrument-shaping-real-estate-decisions."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Certainly this period has witnessed at least two of the most remarkable and complex scenarios in economic recent history that deserve to be explained given its relevance for US society in general and households paying a mortgage in particular: <strong>I) the Great Recession</strong>, the economic downturn that occurred between December 2007 and June 2009. II) <strong>The COVID19 health emergency</strong> declared in January 2020.</p>
<p>In accordance with conventional economic theory, a fundamental factor influencing the overall fluctuations in the aggregate price level is the cost of borrowing, formally known as the interest rate. Interest rates are a core instrument of monetary policy that play a pivotal role in shaping economic dynamics and has significant implications for various sectors of the economy, including real estate markets.</p>
<p>Therefore, understanding the evolution in time of interest rates is crucial for comprehending not only the aggregate price level fluctuations, but also its impacts on particular components, among which housing prices bear a specially important role for households.</p>
<p>We now turn to the analysis of this important macroeconomic determinant and begin by presenting the trajectory overtime for the Federal Funds effective rate.
This rate serves as a benchmark or reference point for other short-term interest rates, exerting a considerable influence on the overall cost of borrowing and lending in the economy.</p>
<p>The importance of the <strong>Federal Funds effective rate (FFER)</strong> is particularly pronounced in relation to the housing sector and real estate markets. Firstly, it directly affects the cost of mortgage borrowing for home buyers. Changes in the Federal Funds rate can lead to adjustments in mortgage interest rates, impacting affordability and demand for housing. Lower rates tend to stimulate borrowing and housing activity, while higher rates may dampen demand. This inverse relation is paramount to explain supply and demand side factors that have been taking place in the US housing market as we will soon discover.</p>
<p>Figure 4, presents the evolution of the FFER in the period from to July 2000 to May 2023.</p>

<p>The representation above covers 23 years of Federal Funds effective rate fluctuations. Over the span of this period, monetary policy has experienced important changes with implications for the housing markets.</p>
<p>The first, marked here with a benchmark date in reference to the <strong>sub-prime mortgage market collapse</strong> <a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Sub-prime mortgage is defined here as higher-risk loans granted to borrowers with lower creditworthiness&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a>, An episode in the recent economic history of the United States that embodies one of the primary determinants shaping the so called <strong>“Great Recession.”</strong></p>
<p>Prior to this period, the Federal Reserve´s monetary policy had set the FFER at <span class="math inline">\(5.26\%\)</span> which its the highest interest level that US society has experienced between July 2007 and the moment of the writing of this work (May 2023).</p>
<p>Following the sub-prime mortgage market collapse, which set the stage for the beginning of the global financial crisis, the US central bank, decided to implement measures via the its key monetary policy instruments, to stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>Considering the substantial scale and breadth of the economic contraction, it was anticipated that the path to recovery would entail a protracted ascent. Consequently, the Federal Funds Effective Rate (FFER) underwent a deliberate reduction, plummeting to historically low levels, reaching a floor of <span class="math inline">\(0.07\%\)</span> by January 2014.</p>
<p>How does the housing market reacted to this unprecedented period of ultra low interest rates?</p>
<p>Before moving on to answer that question, let´s study a second relevant shift in monetary policy. According to empirical evidence shown above, the monetary policy stimulus period to promote economic recovery related to the <strong>Great Recession</strong>, lasted 7 years, (Jan 2009-Dec 2015).</p>
<p>However, when quantitative easing<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the present investigation we use the term Quantitative easing to refer to a monetary policy tool employed by central banks to stimulate the economy and promote lending and investment. QE involves the central bank purchasing government bonds or other financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions. By doing so, the central bank injects new money into the financial system, increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates. The aim of quantitative easing is to encourage borrowing and spending, thereby boosting economic activity&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> seemed to be ending; on January 31, 2020, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Public Health Service Act, declared a public COVID-19 health emergency. This declaration allowed the HHS to activate emergency response mechanisms, mobilize resources and coordinate efforts to contain and mitigate the spread of the public health threat within the country.</p>
<p>Among those measures, as we now know, there were significant mobility restrictions that infringed an unprecedented toll on economic activity with emphasis in the labor market. Triggering a relevant economic slowdown, that required once more, a decisive intervention by the central bank authorities to prevent a deeper economic crisis and to stimulate a recovery.</p>
<p>In this unprecedented complex global economic setting, the Federal Reserve of the United States decided to move the FFER from a <span class="math inline">\(2.4\%\)</span> in July 2019 to an ultra low <span class="math inline">\(0.05\%\)</span> in April 2020, (the lowest on record in this century) sending a clear signal to the markets in an effort to stimulate spending and investment aiming to correct the <strong>sharp decline in consumer spending</strong> associated with the labor market disruptions caused by the overall restrictive measures put in place during the global health emergency.</p>
<p>This dovish monetary policy strategy was extended for almost two years and only started to be normalized by April 2022.</p>

<p>To capture the broader social dimension and the effects of this economic determinants on the housing markets, we proposed to analyze Google search data. A social sentiment data driven approach by which we compare the relative search frequency overtime for specific terms related to the housing market. This approach has been gaining increasing attention and it offers a complementary perspective.</p>
<p>The following analysis contains the Google score trend for terms: “affordable home”, “foreclosure” and “eviction”. This terms are plotted against particular macroeconomic policy threshold dates and external shocks events. Results are shown by figure 5. Specifically with this terms selection the segment of home owners and renters are incorporated into the analysis.</p>

<p>We can clearly note the effect of the <em>sub-prime mortgage market</em> collapse in the population sentiment reflected as a higher volume of search for terms such as “affordable home” which indicate a tight real state market during the second quarter of <strong>2009</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, during this period we found the highest scores over the last two decades for the term <strong>foreclosure</strong><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;a legal process in which a lender attempts to recover the balance of a loan from a borrower who has stopped making payments to the lender by forcing the sale of the asset used as the collateral for the loan.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a>, interestingly enough, when we analyze “eviction” a term that reflects housing market stress associated to the <strong>renters segment</strong>, we observe a clear indication of the labor market tightening caused by the <strong>health emergency restrictions</strong> after January <strong>2020</strong>.</p>

<p>For existing home owners, home equity has more than double during the last decade (from 2006Q4 to 2022Q4 with a 213% growth).</p>
<p><strong>Why there was such growth in home equity in the nation during the last decade?</strong></p>
<p>As we have seen, monetary policy is partially responsible for this trend, given a sustained period of quantitative easing. (starting from December 2008 with a Federal reserve effective rate (FFFER) = <span class="math inline">\(0.16\%\)</span> down from <span class="math inline">\(5.26\%\)</span> in July 2007 -prior to sub prime mortgage market collapse- Followed by a second ultra low FFER period that was implemented to cope with a deceleration of the economy in the presence of the global public health emergency triggered by the COVID-19 restrictions, starting at 2020Q1 with FFER = <span class="math inline">\(0.05\%\)</span> down from FFER=<span class="math inline">\(2.40 \%\)</span> in june 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Who benefited from this historical monetary policy scenario characterized by ultra low interest rate?</strong></p>
<p>Specially people who bought homes in attracting real state markets areas with dynamic internal migration patterns, who manage to <strong>profit</strong> from this <strong>historic ultra low interest rate</strong> period, by entering the market and securing a Fixed-rate mortgage just after the sub prime mortgage collapse, that is <strong>between December 2008 and November 2015.</strong></p>
<p>This movers took advantage of the economic stimulus provided by the macroeconomic environment created with a monetary policy oriented for <strong>quantitative easing</strong>, a strategy designed to lower the price of money in an effort to boost consumption and investment, among other things. For example, <strong>home equity</strong> for existing housing stock in the US in 2012Q1 was <strong><span class="math inline">\(10.25\)</span>T</strong> and it <strong>grew to <span class="math inline">\(33.78\)</span>T in 10 years</strong>, a <strong>3X order of magnitude increase!</strong></p>
<p>In addition, detailed mortgage records kept by government sponsored enterprises such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, allow to distinguish the type of loan granted to actual current mortgage clients, this data is important to show real estate investment trends across Metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>Nationwide <strong>87.3%</strong> of <strong>Freddie Mac clients</strong> are paying a loan for a house that is a <strong>primary residence.</strong> Almost <strong>4%</strong> of Freddie Mac home buyers are buying a <strong>second home</strong>. And <strong>8.9%</strong> are paying a home loan classified as <strong>investment.</strong></p>
<p>If we think of <strong>second home loans</strong> as a proxy for social status, say, better off household apply for this type of loan, then the families in the states of <strong>Virginia, Vermont, Delaware Maine and Florida</strong> are the places were this type of families mostly live.</p>
<p>Figure 7 below ranks metropolitan areas (MSAs) by the number of loans classified as investment by Freddie Mac single family loan data for the first quarter of 2022 <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-freddiemachomeSingleFamilyLoanLevel2023" role="doc-biblioref">Freddie Mac Home 2023</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The information above for loan category: investment, indicates which metropolitan areas are conceived as dynamic real estate centers across the nation. It is found that The <strong>Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale Arizona MSA</strong>, shows the highest investment property type of loans in the US for data on the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Furthermore, data analysis at the state scale indicates that <strong>California</strong> is the state with the highest percentage of home loans classified as investment (<span class="math inline">\(11.88\%\)</span> a proportion statistically different from the US median <span class="math inline">\(7.9\%\)</span>). Given the raising trend for home prices in the state, this pattern suggest the presence of speculative pressures, that may limit the supply of affordable homes in this particular area of the country.</p>
<p>Lets now analyze from a geographic perspective, how home prices have appreciated during this economic policy changes.</p>
<p>Figure 8 below shows a national perspective for the distribution of home price index developed by Freddie Mac in a monthly series which takes as base year 2000. The figure shows year 2006 figures in order to capture a moment in time prior to the implementation of a dovish monetary policy and then it allows comparison to the current year 2023.</p>

<p>Evidence suggest that before the great recession and prior to the implementation of quantitative easing monetary policies, the US housing market, featured California and Florida as the top most expensive regions of the country. Together with a well defined region along the north eastern cost with New York Virginia and Maryland comprised a traditional high cost set of states. Virtually the central regions of the country were not showing sings of significant house price increases as of 2006.</p>
<p>As we have shown, the implementation of historic measures to stabilize the economic environment lead to very special and not usual conditions that served as changing forces that have impacted the real state market landscape. These factors created both, market incentives for investment opportunities as well as affordability issues for some segments of the US population, that in the face of being price-out are reinforcing current internal migration patterns.</p>

<p>Following the implementation of macroeconomic policy with an extended period of favorable interest rates, empirical evidence suggest that the housing market have been diversifying out of the <strong>traditional high cost regions</strong> of the country.</p>
<p>In this regard we identify at least two important geographic patterns I) A movement of high housing prices from the pacific west cost towards the northeastern states closer to Canadian border. Also, considering the south, two Mexican border states are showing a rapidly increasing real state market: Arizona and Texas II) Traditionally expensive states in the north east, have been experiencing a relative cooling off in favor of emerging regions.</p>
<p>There are two particular cases that require a closer examination:</p>
<p><strong>The case of Arizona</strong> The significant House Price Index (HPI) increase observed in Arizona, particularly in the Phoenix metropolitan area, can be attributed to various real estate elements and economic features. Some factors that may explain this trend include: population growth and economic development, both factors impacting prices via a growing housing demand.</p>
<p>Population Growth: Phoenix has experienced substantial population growth over the last two decades. The increasing population creates a higher demand for housing, leading to upward pressure on home prices, as shown by figure 9 below.</p>
<p>Economic Development: Phoenix has been a hub for economic development, attracting industries such as technology, finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. The presence of major companies, business-friendly policies related to tax regulations, and a growing job market have contributed to the region’s economic growth. This, in turn, stimulates demand for housing which exhibits a direct positive relation to price increases as we will now analyze using population, per capita income and house prices at a metropolitan area scale for selected US-Mexico Border (MSAs).</p>
<p><strong>The case of Idaho.</strong></p>
<p>Migration patterns: According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s population estimates and migration data, Idaho has experienced consistent net positive domestic migration (inflow of people from other states, particularly from high-cost areas like California and the Pacific Northwest) over the past two decades.</p>
<p>Within Idaho, specific Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) have experienced substantial population flows from other out-of-state MSAs. For example, the <strong>Boise metropolitan area</strong>, which includes Ada County, has been a major recipient of in-migration. It has attracted individuals and families from various out-of-state MSAs, including mainly areas in California, Washington and Oregon. Chapter 2 analyses internal migration flows in detail.</p>

<p>Finally figure 9 below represents the evolution of house prices for US Mexico border Metropolitan statistical areas.</p>

<p>The clear upward trend for San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad area situated right across the Border from the major Mexican border city Tijuana, certainly represents a relevant case study considering affordability restrictions and opportunities that appear given this close geographic proximity.</p>
<p>Considering evidence on real state market prices in Californian (MSAs), labor market conditions as well as supply and demand exogenous shocks, the analysis suggest that search for affordability may be one of the reasons why some people have decided to relocate out of state or even to make the move across the border, this is however an hypothesis that is subject to further empirical validation.</p>
