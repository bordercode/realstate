It is the basis of all security and about the only indestructible security” — Russell Sage Economic relationships between Mexico and the US have been increasing at a dynamic pase during the first decades of this century. Partially responsible for this trend are specific policy instruments that have been designed to deliver a mutual benefit for the interests of both countries. However at a local scale, particular economic sectors have been shaped by this partnership. From a public policy perspective one of those areas of concern where there is a growing interest to understand bi national interaction is housing prices and the underlying real state markets. Specially given that housing markets are closely related to economic determinants, including labor market dynamics, that influence a series of important social processes such as migration patterns; understanding house price fluctuations can be particularly relevant for regional development. Considering an economic perspective, there are at least five key indicators that demonstrate the increasing US-Mexico integration: trade patterns and resulting supply chain links, productive investment, labor market dynamics, remittances trends and tourism flows. Considering the exchange of goods and services, according to United States Census Bureau, based on data from the Foreign Trade Division, in 2020, Mexico was the US’s second-largest goods trading partner, with a total of $577.6 billion in two-way trade (Office of the United States Trade 2021). To place in perspective this trade volume, a contrast against the size of the whole Mexican economy measured by the gross domestic product, revels that the US-Mexico trade value accounted for 52.9%1 of the total Méxican GDP in 2020,(inegi2020?),(Economía 2020) a robust figure if we consider China, Méxicos´s second largest trading partner after the US, whose´s trade value, accounted for a 7.6%(Economía 2020), (Bank 2021) share of the country´s GDP for the same period of time. Furthermore, the Mexican total trade volume in 2020 was worth in current prices 1.03 trillion,(bank 2020) which means that the US-Mexico trade volume represented over half of all Mexican world trade. The US-México trade relationship was further propelled by the implementation of the (USMCA) agreement, also known in Spanish as the T-MEC (Tratado entre México Estados Undos y Canadá), which was created during the Trump administration and signed by member countries on November 30, 2018, during the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Representative 2018). When productive investment is considered, particular regions in México have turned into strategic logistic hubs and supply chain pillars to support the manufacturing and resulting trade flows that currently define the US-Mexico economic relationship. Among this regional economic hubs, the Mexican northern border represent a clear example, where geographic proximity enables efficient productive integration between both countries. Current features of the global economy impacting the north american region such as near-shoring, a trend partially influenced by a less dynamic post pandemic US-China relationship, are expanding productive partnerships between Mexico and the US in cities across it’s share border region with tangible results on important local markets. Additionally, as the Mexican population living in the US has increased, the total amount of money sent from the US to Mexico has experienced a significant growth over the past few decades and have developed into a major source of foreign currency. According to the World Bank, total remittance volume from the US to Mexico increased from $2.4 billion in 1995 to $40.6 billion in 2020, (The World Bank 2021) furthermore in 2020, remittances accounted for 4.2% of Mexico’s GDP.(Bank of Mexico 2021) which places the country among the highest remittances recipients in the world. Although this robust currency flow indicates a high level of economic and labor market interaction between both countries, Mexico´s dependence on external sources of income highlights an area of opportunity regarding sustainable economic development and job creation within the country that has been regarded by some scholars such as (López-Feldman, Novelo-Maldonado, and Villa 2020), (Hanson 2006), as one of the causes of north bound irregular migration in the first place. Whereas economic ties among the two countries are a clear indication of a strong integration and provide a portrait of underlying productive structure and it´s related labor markets, there are several industries where economic asymmetries have been developing impacting local communities and its residents. Empirically it can be argued that each of these economic features has been influencing most of Mexican regions, with wide scale impacts, going beyond the economic sphere, ranging from environmental, urban planning and public health, however a particular geographic region where this economic structure translates into a continuous tangible social development process is the Mexican northern border. At a regional scale and particularly considering the US-Mexico border population centers, one of such areas where impacts are of concern, is real state and the resulting housing market. While the manufacturing industrial sector demand for warehouse space for instance, has been a key driver of commercial land prices in these border urban areas, until recently, less understood were Mexico´s northern border city´s residential housing patterns. A central argument for this work is that explaining regional economic dynamics is relevant to better understand local scale opportunities that the US-Mexico relationship offers to improve border residents´s quality of live. Following a data driven approach this research work analyzes housing prices on US Metropolitan areas and internal migration patterns within US states, with a focus in California and it´s southern border region. This analysis is important to understand recent real state features such as residential space demand at bi-national urban areas and to provide key insights not just to implement adaptation policies to prevent negative side effects, but to design strategies based on evidence to guide a long run development process.

This book is organized into 3 chapters: Chapter I sets the stage to understand House prices as internal migration determinants, Chapter II examines homeless trends across US metropolitan areas a perspective that offers a look to a central issue when analyzing home affordability. Chapter III explores bi national real estate market implications at a regional scale focusing on the US Mexico border presenting an emblematic case study: the San Diego-Tijuana connection. References "],["house-prices-as-internal-migration-determinants..html", "1 House prices as internal migration determinants. 1.1 Data and methods.", " 1 House prices as internal migration determinants. From an economic perspective, house prices represent a main component of inflation, overall price level trends are currently a priority for economic policy in general and particularly relevant when studying residential mobility. Empirical evidence reported by current academic research (Stawarz, Sander, and Sulak 2021) as well as market experts (S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 2023), indicate that, beyond labor market incentives, housing affordability represent a key factor when considering the selection of a place to reside (Füss and Zietz 2016). In fact, real state markets may play a critical role for important social processes such as migration, both internal (within the same country)3 or international. In this chapter, exploratory data analysis is conducted on house property values, focusing on metropolitan areas as the geographic scale across the US. Metropolitan areas are geographic units that are particularly suited to understand regional real state dynamics and provide a base scenario to study internal migration patterns within the US territory as well as specific regions such as the US-Mexico border. 1.1 Data and methods. The study strategy follows a spatial and temporal design, it is argued that analyzing housing costs evolution in a geographic context may reveal patterns that help to better understand residential mobility and deliver valuable insights about internal migration flows and the underlying regional economic incentives. The primary spatial unit of analysis for this study is the Metropolitan Statistical area (MSAs). MSAs are geographical regions defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that consist of one or more counties that contain a core city of 50,000 or more inhabitants, and surrounding areas with significant social and economic ties (Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration 1990). It is argued that Metropolitan statistical areas provide an appropriate level of detail, improving over the aggregate perspective that states offer or the traditional county boundaries scale, which lack the economic synergies and the broad social component that MSAs achieve by considering the interaction between a core and a set of adjacent communities. For this theoretical considerations MSAs were selected over other alternative geographical scales for this particular analysis. The study covers all 48 continental adjacent US states, excluding: District of Columbia, Alaska and non continental territories Hawaii and Puerto Rico. A primary goal is to explore real state market fluctuations over time, to achieve this purpose we measure three concepts: house price levels, price appreciation and purchasing parity based on housing prices. To measure house price levels the main input variable is the quarterly seasonally adjusted house price index for the period 1991:Q1 (base year) to 2022:Q4 for 387 MSAs for which Federal housing finance agency (FHFA) price indices are available. The FHFA House Price Index (FHFA HPI) is a broad economic measure of the movement of single family house prices in the United States (FHFA 2022). The data set analyzed in this chapter contains purchase only transactions, the aim is to capture the price level fluctuations a feature estimated by using sales price data as opposed to appreciation. (which considers a repet transaction methodology. To measure the underlying rate of appreciation of a given house price, the Freddie Mac House price index (FMHPI), is incorporated. This is a repeat transaction index, which compares the price of the same property over two or more transactions and is explicitly designed to capture appreciation while holding constant basic factors such as physical location, climate, housing type, etc.,between transactions. (Freddie Mac 2023). By construction, therefore, the repeat transaction requirement exclude new homes. Whereas HPI in data sets such as FHFA, measures current price level not considering transactions over the same property. To complement the perspective obtained by the Federal housing finance agency HPI data and the Freddie Mac HPI, the housing component of the regional price parities (RPPs) indicator for year 2022 (the latest release as the time of writing this investigation) is included. This is an official indicator reported by the Bureau of economic analysis (BEA) which measure the differences in price levels across states and metropolitan areas for a given year and are expressed as a percentage of the overall national price level(Bureau of Economic Analysis 2023b). This indicator is particularly informative of the population buying power, specially it allows price comparisons relative to the national average. To capture demand side factors, Official population estimates from the US Census Bureau were obtained for years 2010-2020 [US Census Bureau (2023), this is a variable that captures demographic dynamics overtime and serve as a proxy for housing demand. Per capita personal Income (PPI) by metropolitan area from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis is also included. (Bureau of Economic Analysis 2023a). This variable contributes to capture inequality and financial barriers to access the housing market. In addition the income to house price ratio is useful to inform on the contextual factors affecting the decisions to move. To understand out-migration related to real state markets a relevant indicator is the income to house price ratio, this measure captures two dimensions of what is termed in this work as the priced-out effect a situation defined by the pressure that unaffordable housing prices relative to income infringes on the population, which in turn as has been documented by (Meen and Whitehead 2020b), (Meen and Whitehead 2020a), (Lens 2018), (Molloy, Smith, and Wozniak 2011)and others, increases the probability of search for a new destination. 1.1.1 Exploratory data analysis. The analysis is organized in two stages: the first provides a national approach to the housing prices fluctuations for metropolitan areas in all states. While the second focuses on the US Mexico border region. when we analyze inflation patterns, the housing component for the regional price parity (RPP),developed by Bureau of economic analysis to measure price fluctuations at a regional scale, it is possible to distinguish which states of the country hold the most expensive housing markets. Here the base level national average is 100 The following graph shows this pattern for the 50 US states for 2021.

The housing market for Mexican cities at the US border has been attracting the attention of the academic community with a growing interest with particular emphasis after the 2009 financial crisis, and several studies have documented case studies where demand for residential space by population coming from the US(Kim 2020), are shaping the real state landscapes in the Mexican side. A behavior that in turn creates a local upward path for housing prices on border urban areas on the Mexican side such as Tijuana, where local people facing higher housing prices are being priced out of residential areas suitable to accommodate an increasing housing demand that newcomers from the north are creating. Empirical evidence documented by ecademic experts on the field such as Soto-Rubui and Hausman, (Soto-Rubio and Hausman 2019) indicates that the local real estate market has experimented continuous pressures that has resulted in affordability issues for residents in Mexican cities such as Tijuana or Juárez. In this chapter the goal is to analyze the economic conditions that explain the movement of people from the US into Mexican border cities. And it´s effects on real estate industry, in particular the chapter focuses on the biggest Mexican border city Tijuana. Tijuana, Baja California is located at the US Mexico border just across the city of San Diego. Given it´s privilege location, Tijuana has become the biggest population center and a strategic economic hub along the entire Mexican border. This city hosts the busiest pedestrian and personal Vehicle passenger port of entry to the US along the northern Mexican Border. According to official information provided by the Bureau of transportation statistics, during 2022, California ports of entry registered 16,104,055 pedestrian crossings and among these, the San Ysidro gate, situated right at Tijuana´s city heart, accounts for 6,678,157 pedestrian crossings, surpassing the traffic registered by second busiest port El Paso, by 82%. [INSERT PLOT HER FOR WIAT TIMES AND TRAFFIC BY TYPE: EJ. PASSANGER VS. TRUCKS (COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY)] This intense people movement reflects the underlying social dynamics that this region generates which are strongly influenced by specific economic determinants, one such key driving factor being bi-national labor market conditions and housing market prices differentials. Historically, there has been several structural factors that contribute to housing shortages in the Mexican city of Tijuana.(Soto-Rubio and Hausman 2019), however recently, added pressures of binational economic nature, to enter the housing market have emerged, for the local population living in specific neighborhoods situated in close proximity to border crossings or residential areas that are particularly attractive to US commuters and remote workers coming from the San Diego area and the southern California region. As a result, a surge in real estate development has occurred in the area known as Playas de Tijuana and Rosarito, where property prices have experienced rapid growth during the last decade. !!!!!!!
