# The San Diego-Tijuana connection.

The housing market for Mexican cities at the US border has been attracting the attention of the academic community with a growing interest with particular emphasis after the 2009 financial crisis, and several studies have documented case studies where demand for residential space by population coming from the US[@kim2020emergence], are shaping the real state landscapes in the Mexican side.    

A behavior that in turn creates a local upward path for housing prices on border urban areas on the Mexican side such as Tijuana, where local people facing higher housing prices are being priced out of residential areas suitable to accommodate an increasing housing demand that newcomers from the north are creating.

Empirical evidence documented by Academic experts on the field such as  Soto-Rubui and Hausman, [@SOTORUBIO201976] indicates that the local real estate market has experimented continuous pressures that has resulted in affordability issues for residents in Mexican cities such as Tijuana or Juárez. 

In this chapter the goal is to analyze the economic conditions that explain the movement of people from the US into Mexican border cities. And it´s effects on real estate industry, in particular the chapter focuses on the biggest Mexican border city Tijuana. 

Tijuana, Baja California is located at the US Mexico border just across the city of San Diego. 
Given it´s privilege location, Tijuana has become the biggest population center and a strategic economic hub along the entire Mexican border.

This city hosts the busiest pedestrian and personal Vehicle passenger port of entry to the US along the northern Mexican Border. 

According to official information provided by the Bureau of transportation statistics, during 2022, California ports of entry registered 16,104,055 pedestrian crossings and among these, the San Ysidro gate, situated right at Tijuana´s city heart, accounts for 6,678,157 pedestrian crossings, surpassing the traffic registered by second busiest port El Paso, by 82%.

This intense people movement reflects the underlying social dynamics that this region generates[@doi:10.1177/019791839603000407] which are strongly influenced by specific economic determinants, one such key driving factor being bi-national labor market conditions and housing market prices differentials.

Historically, there has been several structural factors that contribute to housing shortages in the Mexican city of Tijuana.[@SOTORUBIO201976], however recently, added pressures of binational economic nature, to enter the housing market have emerged, for the local population living in specific neighborhoods situated in close proximity to border crossings or residential areas that are particularly attractive to US commuters and remote workers coming from the San Diego area and the southern California region.


As a result, a surge in real estate development has occurred in the area known as Playas de Tijuana and Rosarito, where property prices have experienced rapid growth during the last decade.
